Approval Congratulations! The majority of F-1 visa applicants are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you. Denials 214(b) Denial Although F-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their students and any qualifying periods of post-completion OPT or STEM OPT. The F-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer\u2019s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when an F-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your F-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. PP 10043 Denial On May 29, 2020, a Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China\u2019s \u201cmilitary-civil fusion strategy.\u201d This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected. Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations. If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance. Students should review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials. Administrative Processing The outcome of some F-1 visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as \u201c Administrative Processing .\u201d Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months. In these cases, the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. You should follow the instructions listed on the 221(g) notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS\u00a0by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance. What is \u201cAdministrative Processing\u201d? After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including: Your country of birth or citizenship Academic or employment history, including military experience Travel history Source of funding Past U.S. immigration records Family members\u2019 backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence Geopolitical factors These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn\u2019t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields. Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa. Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process. If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment. Next Steps During Administrative Processing If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process. Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing.", "tests": {"What should I do if my F-1 visa application is denied under 214(b)?": "You should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer and be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns regarding your potential immigrant intent.", "How long can Administrative Processing take after a visa interview?": "Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months.", "What is the impact of Presidential Proclamation 10043 on F or J visa applicants?": "The proclamation suspends entry for certain Chinese nationals connected to entities supporting China\u2019s 'military-civil fusion strategy' and does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas.", "Will my visa application be denied if I have a family member with a controversial background?": "No Answer"}}, {"document": "Expedited Visa Appointments U.S. Embassies/Consulates overseas may be able to expedite your F-1 visa interview date if your I-20 program start date is within 60 days, and there are no available visa interview slots prior to your start date.

However, the Admissions Committee was impressed by your intellectual curiosity and believes that you have the academic and personal accomplishments to be successful in your chosen graduate degree program. Therefore, we are pleased to offer you conditional admission to Northeastern University based on successful completion of Global Pathways. What costs will I pay to attend with Global Pathways? To enroll, you will be required to pay a one-time, non-refundable enrollment deposit of $3,000.

This applies to all visitors if someone is inviting them, including visitors from visa exempt countries.

Visa officers assess the applications to decide whether the person invited meets the terms of Canada\u2019s immigration laws. Similarly, border officers at ports of entry will consider all the relevant factors in accordance with Canada\u2019s immigration laws, including purpose of entry in making the decision to allow entry.

A Study Permit is the immigration document issued by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) that provides permission for an international student to study in Canada. This permit is your status document while you are studying in Canada and you must make sure to meet the requirements of your study permit. See here for more information about the conditions under a study permit. It is your responsibility to ensure that your Study Permit is valid for the duration of your academic program in Canada. If you are from a country that requires an entry visa (TRV) OR an eTA, this will be issued for you upon approval of your study permit \u2013 you do not make a separate application for a travel visa. On approval, you will be given a visa or eTA and a letter of introduction to travel to Canada and you will be issued your study permit upon arriving at the Port of Entry in Canada. When to Apply The Study Permit application process can be lengthy. It is very important you apply for the permit as soon as you receive the Proof of Acceptance letter. We recommend applying a minimum of 3-4 months before your program start date. Be sure to check with IRCC to determine the estimated processing time based on your country of application. Proof of Acceptance (POA) Letter You will need your Proof of Acceptance letter (POA) (also called Letter of Acceptance) to submit with your Study Permit application. The POA will be available to download on your application portal, where you will also find your Admission Letter. Please note that OGS Canada does not issue POAs under normal circumstances . POAs are generated automatically in your portal and should become available to you 6-8 months before your program start date. Confirm Your Enrolment Once you claim your NU account, use your Northeastern credentials to login to the applicant\u2019s portal using the link provided in your acceptance package. Payments International students applying for a study permit are not eligible to pay the first-year tuition in advance. They will receive a deposit invoice for $500 CAD. After confirming enrolment, you should receive an email (to both the registered email account and the NU Student email) from Student Accounts Canada with payment instructions. If you have questions about this process, please see here . After you make the payment using the payment portal, you will be issued a receipt within two weeks via email, depending on your method of payment, to attach to your study permit application. The confirmation email will be sent from the Student Accounts Canada team.", "tests": {"What is a Study Permit?": "A Study Permit is the immigration document issued by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) that provides permission for an international student to study in Canada.", "When should I apply for my Study Permit?": "You should apply for the Study Permit as soon as you receive the Proof of Acceptance letter, and it is recommended to apply a minimum of 3-4 months before your program start date.", "What is required to submit with my Study Permit application?": "You will need your Proof of Acceptance letter (POA) to submit with your Study Permit application.", "What happens if I do not secure a study permit before my classes start?": "No Answer"}}, {"document": "Apply for your Study Permit Students may apply for their Study Permit via an online application portal or via paper application. You also have the option of using the services of an authorized third party application collection service, called a Visa Application Centre (VAC) . If you are able, apply using the online application portal, as generally, online applications are processed more quickly than paper applications. Estimated processing times per country are available on the IRCC site. All the information you need for the Study Permit application process is available on the IRCC website. This process is not managed by Northeastern University and we do not have additional insight into processing times or delays. If you choose to use the services of an immigration advisor or lawyer to assist you with your application, please be certain to choose someone who is legally permitted to represent you to IRCC.

Documents Required for Initial Study Permit Please visit the official IRCC website for the complete details. Please make sure to also read the visa office specific guidelines for your country of nationality. Provincial Attestation Letter On September 18th, 2024, IRCC announced master\u2019s and doctoral students will need to submit a provincial or territorial attestation letter (PAL or TAL) to support their study permit application, in the 2025-2026 study permit application intake. Study permit applications submitted on January 22, 2025 or later , will require a PAL. If you have an offer of admission for Fall 2025, your POA should be issued shortly. Once you have your POA for Fall 2025, please submit your study application to IRCC no later than January 21, 2025. If you have a POA issued for Fall 2025 and you do not submit your study permit application prior to January 22, 2025 , you will need to obtain a new POA and request a PAL. Please continue to check this page for further instructions on requesting a PAL. Information on the process to request a PAL will be updated on our website site as soon as we receive information from our Provincial governments. We strongly recommend that all new admitted students attend one of the OGS Canada Study Permit information sessions prior to submitting your study permit application. Click here for more information on event dates and registration. 2024 Study Permit Applications: Study permit applications submitted in 2024 for programs on the Master\u2019s level are exempt from PAL/TAL until January 22nd, 2025. If you have been admitted to a Northeastern University Canadian campus and you will apply for your study permit in 2024, you may continue to follow the current process to apply for study permit. You will not be issued a PAL and you don\u2019t need to have a PAL. Program End Date/Completion Date You will need to use the estimated amount of time shown on your POA in the Length of Program section to provide an estimate of your Completion Date. For example, if your POA states: Completion Date: N/K Or minimum 20 months of full-time studies Then your Completion Date should be estimated as 20 months after your Program Start Date. We cannot provide students with a specific date , as the length of time varies with every student depending on co-op opportunities, leaves of absence, course schedules etc. You will be able to apply for Study Permit Extension if you ended up needing more time to complete the program. New Policy Updates \u2013 December 2023 As a reminder, starting January 1, 2024, the cost-of-living financial requirement for study permit applicants will be raised so that international students are financially prepared for life in Canada. Moving forward, this threshold will be adjusted each year when Statistics Canada updates the low-income cut-off (LICO). LICO represents the minimum income necessary to ensure that an individual does not have to spend a greater than average portion of income on necessities. For 2024, a single applicant will need to show they have $20,635, representing 75% of LICO, in addition to their first year of tuition and travel costs. This change will apply to new study permit applications received on or after January 1, 2024.

Often, OGS is one of the first interactions students and scholars have with a department on campus. It is our goal to provide a home-away-from-home for our students and scholars and a welcoming community where students can be their authentic selves, as well as celebrate and embrace our students and scholars. Some examples include: Global Student Mentor Program (GSM) Events and programs for students to come together to explore and learn about their campus/surrounding areas, such as kayaking in the Charles River, and providing opportunities to learn about and celebrate holidays in their campus country, such as Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, etc. Beyond Borders events to bring international and domestic students together to share common experiences and to learn about different countries and opportunities to study or learn abroad. Providing support to students and scholars during their transition to their campus country to create connections with campus resources, faculty, staff, and their peers Professional Skill Development The Office of Global Services aims to provide leadership development for the international student and scholar population to encourage skill building opportunities for their future. International students and scholars often have different cultural norms which can pose challenges in adjusting to the education or working system in their campus country. Through OGS programming, students and scholars can increase their skills needed to be successful in their program, the workplace, and more.

If the J-1 scholar has already spent five years at their current sponsor, they will be ineligible to transfer. There can be no gap in between J-1 program dates The transfer of sponsorship from one sponsor to the other sponsor must take place immediately; the new sponsor must agree to take over J-1 sponsorship the day after the current sponsor agrees to end their sponsorship.

Please note that this is not a visa denial. Additionally, for J-1 scholars conducting research in certain STEM fields, your application may undergo additional security screening as part of administrative processing. This can often take several months and it is difficult to get updates from the Embassy during that time. You should follow the instructions on the 221(g) to provide any requested information or documentation.

Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing. Visa Denials Although J-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their J-1 program. The J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer\u2019s questions, and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a J-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. You can apply again for the J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa refusals and visa denials.

The more common method of gaining J-1 status (as outlined in the first sections of this page) is through traveling and re-entering the U.S. in your new J-1 visa status. In this case, you must apply for a J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad. Applying at the local Embassy/Consulate in your home country is recommended. You can enter the U.S. no earlier than 30 days before the DS-2019 program start date. Depending on your situation, you may prefer to leave the U.S. to obtain the J-1 visa instead of proceeding with the change of status process in the U.S. If you currently hold C, D, K, WB or WT status, you are not eligible to change to any other status within the U.S., including J-1. If you or your family are currently in J status (including J-2) and you are subject to the Two-Year Foreign Residency Requirement INA 212(e) , you may not change status in the U.S. unless you have been granted a waiver.

We stron g ly recommend filing \u201c premium processing \u201d (which includes an additional $1,750 fee) to expedite the adjudication of your change of status application to ensure you can start your J-1 program on time. PLEASE NOTE: The Office of Global Services (OGS) can provide genera l information regarding the process, requirements, and timeline for an I-539 change of status application, however, since this is your personal immigration application, we cannot assist with detailed question or assist you in filing the application. We recommend consulting with an experienced immigration attorney if you require assistance filing your application beyond the general information provided on this page. DS-2019 Request Process You will follow the same steps outlined in the first section on this page to confirm your appointment at Northeastern and initiate a DS-2019 request to OGS. Once you have received your DS-2019 from OGS, you may begin the process of submitting your change of status application to USCIS. Required Documents To request a change to J-1 status, you must submit the following documents to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) : A completed USCIS Form I-539 (and Form I-539 Supplement if you have a spouse and/or dependents who will change to J-2 status). See here for filing instructions . Filing fee of $370: You can pay the fee with a money order, personal check, cashier\u2019s check, or pay by credit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions . If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. OPTIONAL: Premium Processin g \u2013 if you would like to pay an additional fee for premium processing to request that USCIS to provide a decision on your application within 15 days, you will need to submit the $1,750 I-907 premium processing fee. Photocopy of SEVIS fee payment receipt. Photocopy of the Form DS-2019 issued to you and all dependents, properly signed by you. Photocopy of your and any dependent family members\u2019 I-94 record from www.cbp.gov/i94 . Photocopy of information page of your passport (and of each dependent included in the application). Please note: Do not send your original passport. Photocopy of the visa that you used to enter the United States. If there are J-2 dependent applicants, you must submit evidence of their relationship to you (example: birth or marriage certificate with English translation). You must provide evidence of residence abroad or other evidence proving ties to your home country. Proof of financial support matching the source and funding amount listed on your DS-2019 for the entire duration of your J-1 program for you and your dependents. How to File Your Application The filing location for your Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, depends on your filing classification and where you live. You should use the filing address listed on the USCIS website in the \u201cNonimmigrants and Their Dependents\u201d dropdown menu. If you are requesting premium processing service for Form I-539, you must also file Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service , and review the \u201c Where to File \u201d section on that page. After Applying for Change of Status Once you have submitted your change of status application to USCIS, please email your receipt notice and approval notice once your petition is approved to [email\u00a0protected] . Travel Considerations : You will abandon or cancel a pending change of status application by departing the U.S. while the petition is pending. Please also note that a change of status within the U.S. grants you J-1 status to remain in the U.S. and start/continue your J-1 program, however it does not grant you a J-1 visa stamp. If you travel internationally after approval of the J-1 change of status, you will need to apply for the J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad in order to re-enter the U.S. to continue your J-1 program. Review the OGS website for visa application information and travel guidance . Once your change of status is approved, follow the instructions in emails from OGS for viewing the J-1 scholar orientation and completing your researcher confirmation of arrival e-form. If your plans change or you abandon your change of status application, please email [email\u00a0protected] . Important Information Maintaining Status : You must also maintain your current status while your change of status application is pending. Failure to do so may result in USCIS denying your change of status application. If a change of status application is not approved before the requested start date on your Form DS-2019, we must defer your start date to avoid SEVIS record cancellation. If the deferred start date is later than the expiration of your current nonimmigrant status, you may have to extend your current status; this is known as a \u201cbridge\u201d extension. We recommend that you consult an experienced immigration lawyer with questions about procedures and maintenance of status (including the need to file a bridge extension) during the pendency of a change of status application. I-901 SEVIS Fee : All exchange visitors must pay a SEVIS (I-901) fee before applying for a J-1 visa or acquiring J-1 status. If you are a Canadian citizen exempt from the visa requirement, you must still pay this fee prior to submitting your change of status application. You will need Northeastern University\u2019s Exchange Visitor Program Number to complete the Form I-901. The number is: P-1-03057. It is important that you have a receipt for the SEVIS fee payment before applying to change your status in the United States, as you will be required to submit this receipt with your change of status application. *For payment options or for details go to https://www.fmjfee.com/i901fee/index.html .

Unfortunately, in cases where students lose their H-1B employment (due to layoffs, for example) after they have already changed to H-1B, there are typically no options to reclaim unused OPT/STEM OPT time or to have their previous SEVIS record reactivated . Students should carefully consider this when applying to change to H-1B status, and be prepared that they may need to consult with an immigration attorney for next options if their H-1B employment is terminated, and that simply reverting back to F-1 status is often not possible. Students whose F-1 status has or will be changing to H-1B status, or whose H-1B employment has been withdrawn, revoked, or denied, should submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form (or H-1B Denial Notification e-form ) as soon as possible so that OGS may review your case . If your H-1B was withdrawn/revoked/denied and you have questions related to your F-1 status, please also call OGS at +1 617-373-2310 to make an appointment with an OGS advisor. If your H-1B Employer Withdraws/Revokes Your Petition : Please review the information provided on the USCIS website . If your employer can provide evidence that USCIS received the withdrawal notice BEFORE your approved H-1B effective start date, OGS may be able to assist you in submitting a data fix request to SEVP to return your SEVIS record to Active status if you\u2019re otherwise eligible. Please submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form so we can review your case. If your employer did not withdraw your H-1B petition until AFTER the approved H-1B effective start date, you are not eligible to have your F-1 SEVIS record returned to Active status.

The 60-day grace period does not apply to an F-1 student whose accompanying change of status request is denied due to a status violation, misrepresentation, or fraud. In such cases, the F-1 student is ineligible for cap-gap extension of status and the 60-day grace period. Similarly, the 60-day grace period and cap-gap extension of status does not apply to an F-1 student whose petition was revoked based on a finding of a status violation, fraud or misrepresentation discovered following approval.

What should I do next? If USCIS determines that something in your application requires further clarification they will send you a Request for Evidence (RFE). If you receive an RFE, you are required to respond by the deadline listed on the notification. You will also need to submit a copy of the RFE to OGS via the OPT Issue Reporting e-form in OPT Central. Once you have submitted the e-form, a Designated School Official (DSO) will review your RFE and inform you of next steps. If it is determined that no evidence is needed from OGS or from your former academic department, you will receive an email with suggestions about who can provide the requested evidence. If it is determined you need documentation from OGS or your academic department, you will receive an email stating what additional documentation will be provided. RFE Review Process All RFEs are unique, therefore, all supporting letters and documents are drafted based on the specific request of the RFE. OGS may have multiple RFE being reviewed simultaneously, therefore, processing times for RFEs vary based on: The complexity of the RFE and number of required supporting documents The number of departments that are asked to provide supporting documentation The production of the PDSO Letter (the Principal Designated School Official) The due date of the RFE My Post-OPT was denied. What should I do next? Please upload the denial notice to the OPT Issue Reporting e-form in OPT Central. A DSO will review the denial notice and advise you on next steps. My EAD has an error.

Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during non-required terms. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In person (Traditional): All engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Hybrid: The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Remote (Online): The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer\u2019s physical location Full-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization To maintain on-ground presence during a required term while pursuing full-time experiential learning, students have the following options: Option 1 : Engaging on-site (in person) at the employer\u2019s physical location. This can be in-person or hybrid, as defined above Students will be maintaining on-ground presence based on their engagement with the employer Option 2 : Engaging remotely with the employer with simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course Students should enroll in an on-ground course stipulated by their academic program, which must run for the duration of the required academic term. Students should work with their academic department/advisor/co-op advisor to identify a course that is appropriate. Co-op students only : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements. If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor. Part-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization F-1 Students engaged remotely in part-time practical training/experiential learning must couple their part-time practical experience course enrollment with only on-ground courses to meet both the on-ground requirement and the full-time status requirement. As such, students engaging in part-time co-ops are not eligible to maintain their on-ground presence through the EXED course and may not enroll in online classes to meet the minimum credit requirements for the term. Experiential Learning with an Overseas Employer with CPT Authorization F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain their on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above. Failure to Maintain On-Ground Presence If an F-1 student withdraws from or fails to attend their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training, it will be considered a violation of status and the student\u2019s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated. Regardless of the modality of the practical experience, students need regular engagement with both the practical training provider as well as the academic program to confirm successful progression of the practical training experience. Travel during Experiential Learning Engaging on-site at your employer\u2019s physical location or participating in a university designated on-ground course is a mandatory to maintain the on-ground presence required by your F-1 student status. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term, as their F-1 status and academic goals may be negatively impacted.

Part-time CPT (20 hours per week or less) does not accrue time towards the 364-day calculation. When counting CPT days, every day between the start and end date of CPT is included (including the start and end dates). The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization, not the days the student actually worked. This means even if it was a weekend, holiday, vacation etc., it still counts if the student had CPT authorization. It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full-time CPT days have been used per degree level. Students can use previously issued I-20s to document this. Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this e-form . As a reminder, CPT is a benefit of F-1 status, not a guarantee. While students may be able to work up to 364 days while maintaining OPT eligibility, CPT authorization is directly tied to a student\u2019s academic curriculum. Therefore, the amount of CPT for which students are eligible and may be authorized is entirely based on their program of study, as well as F-1 federal regulations.

The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Trump administration could fully implement and enforce the third travel ban on all eight countries. On Jan. 6, 2018, the Trump administration petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, which the U.S. Supreme Court granted on Jan. 19.\u00a0 The U.S. Supreme Court will consider 4 questions: Whether courts can review a challenge to the travel ban executive order at all; Whether the executive order falls within the president\u2019s authority over immigration; Whether the Hawaii district court\u2019s order applies too broadly; and Whether the executive order violates the Constitution\u2019s establishment clause At this time, the Fourth Circuit has not issued a decision. Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available. \u00a0Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions. December 8, 2017 \u2013 USA Supreme Court allows Trump to enforce travel ban until lower courts rule on challenges The U.S. Supreme Court issued an order on Dec. 4, 2017, allowing the Trump administration to implement fully and enforce its newest travel ban while lower courts continue to consider challenges to it. Travel restrictions, which vary by country, will affect certain nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen, unless exempt or granted a waiver pursuant to a presidential proclamation that was issued on Sept. 24. The Trump administration had previously been barred from implementing the ban on its intended effective date of Oct. 18, 2017, after two lower federal courts issued injunctions that temporarily enjoined enforcement of most of the ban\u2019s restrictions. Following the Trump administration\u2019s appeal of those rulings and request for temporary permission to implement the proclamation, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the ban to take effect partially, but exempted travelers with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity in the United States. The Dec. 4 order by the Supreme Court removes the relationship exemption and allows the Trump administration to implement the ban fully while challenges continue in the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and the Ninth Circuits. Specific travel restrictions Effective Dec. 8, 2017, the Trump administration will fully implement the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dec. 4, 2017, order, and nationals of the eight countries will be subject to the following U.S. travel limitations, unless otherwise exempt: \u2022 Chad: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas \u2022 Iran: No nonimmigrant visas except F and M student visas and J exchange visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas \u2022 Libya: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas \u2022 North Korea: No nonimmigrant, immigrant, or diversity lottery visas \u2022 Somalia: Nonimmigrant visa applicants subject to heightened scrutiny; no immigrant or diversity visas \u2022 Syria: No nonimmigrant, immigrant, or diversity lottery visas \u2022 Venezuela: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visas for officials of designated Venezuelan government agencies; other visa holders are subject to verification of traveler information; no restrictions on immigrant or diversity lottery visas \u2022 Yemen: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas Exemptions and waivers Several classes of foreign nationals are exempt from the restrictions, including U.S. lawful permanent residents, dual nationals traveling on a passport from a non-restricted country, foreign nationals who hold a valid U.S. visa or advance parole, and those who were physically in the United States on the applicable original effective date of the travel restrictions. Those who are not exempt may request a waiver when applying for a visa. To be eligible for a waiver, a foreign national must demonstrate that he or she would suffer undue hardship if denied entry, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety and would be in U.S. national interest. Waivers are discretionary and may be difficult to obtain. What this means for travelers Foreign nationals who are currently in the United States, hold a passport from a restricted country (other than exempt dual nationals), and would need to apply for a visa to reenter the United States should carefully consider the risks of international travel and the potential for significant delays. As a reminder, all foreign nationals\u2014including those exempt from the travel restrictions\u2014are subject to national security screening and the potential for additional vetting when applying for a U.S. visa or admission to the United States. Looking ahead The travel restrictions will be implemented while the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal continue to hear challenges to the presidential proclamation. The Ninth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec. 6, 2017, while the Fourth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec. 8, 2017. Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available.

October 26, 2017 \u2013 The Department of Homeland Security began requiring airlines to implement enhanced security measures for flights destined to the USA These enhanced security measures include enhanced screening of passengers and their electronic devices as well as an increase in security standards for aircrafts and airports. More information on the new security standards can be found in the DHS Fact Sheet: Aviation Enhanced Security Measures for All Commercial Flights to the United States. September 27, 2017 \u2013 Country-specific travel ban issued President Trump issued a proclamation that imposes new travel restrictions on eight countries. Five of the eight countries\u2014Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen\u2014were included in the previous travel ban, while three countries\u2014Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela\u2014were added to the revised list. The new restrictions were issued on Sept. 24, 2017, just as the old 90-day travel ban expired, and will go into effect on Oct. 18. Until then, by virtue of the proclamation, the \u201cold\u201d travel ban will continue for individuals from those countries still on the list who do not have a bona fide relationship with a U.S. person or entity. The new restrictions will not be applied to: Current lawful permanent residents Current visa holders Dual nationals traveling on a passport from an unaffected country Asylees Refugees already admitted to the U.S. Individuals granted protection under the Convention Against Torture Restrictions by country: Chad, Libya, and Yemen: Entry as immigrants and non immigrants in business and tourist status is suspended. Iran: Entry as immigrants and nonimmigrants is suspended, except for those in valid student (F and M) or exchange visitor (J) status. Syria and North Korea: Entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants is suspended. Venezuela: Entry in tourist or business visitor status is suspended for officials of certain government agencies involved in screening and vetting practices and their immediate family members. Somalia: Entry as immigrants is suspended and decisions regarding entry as non immigrants will be subject to additional scrutiny. Although Iraq is not technically covered by the new restrictions, the proclamation notes that Iraqi nationals will be subject to additional scrutiny. How long these restrictions will last is uncertain. Countries may be removed or added to the list based upon further review of the effectiveness of their security practices. Waivers will be available on \u201cundue hardship\u201d grounds if a consulate determines the entry would not pose a threat to national security and the admission would be in the national interest. This could include individuals who have already been admitted to the U.S. for extended periods of time. The Supreme Court was set to hear the travel ban case on Oct. 10. The justices canceled that hearing and asked the parties to submit new briefs by Oct. 5. Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available. Please contact the university\u2019s Office of Global Services if you have any questions. August 8, 2017 - State Department updates policy guidance on F-1 student visa applications On\u00a0Aug. 8, the Department of State revised its guidance to consular officers when considering F-1 student visas. The modification provides assistance to consular officers in determining whether an F-1 visa applicant plans to leave the United States after graduation. Due to these changes, students applying for F-1 visas may be asked additional questions regarding their long-term plans and their ties to their home country. The revised policy guidelines can be found here: https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM040205.html . Northeastern will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available about the revised guidance. Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions. August 28, 2017 - In-person interviews for employment-based green card applicants to begin Oct. 1 Beginning on\u00a0Oct. 1, in-person interviews will be required for all applicants seeking an employment-based green card. In the past, in-person interviews could be waived if no additional information was needed. Citizenship and Immigration Services stated that the in-person interviews will allow officers to verify information in applications, discover new relevant information, and assist with evaluating the credibility of applicants. More information about the in-person interviews can be found here: https://www.uscis.gov/news/news-releases/uscis-to-expand-in-person-interview-requirements-for-certain-permanent-residency-applicants . September 1, 2017 - State Department replaces \u201c30/60 Day Rule\u201d On Sept. 1, the Department of State eliminated the \u201c30/60 Day Rule\u201d regarding adjustment of status applications. This rule assisted officials in determining whether an individual would be inadmissible due to inconsistent conduct. The \u201c90 Day Rule\u201d replaced the prior rule and applies to both immigrant and non-immigrant visa applicants. The new rule provides individuals seeking an adjustment of status less flexibility to postpone filings. The \u201c90 Day Rule\u201d can be found here: https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM030209.html . September 13, 2017 \u2013 Trump Administration imposes visa sanctions on four countries On Sept. 13, the Trump administration imposed visa sanctions on Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. According to officials, these four countries have refused to accept or have unreasonably delayed accepting deportees who have been convicted of crimes in the United States. Not all visas have been discontinued. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s announcement regarding the specific visa sanctions can be found here: https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/13/dhs-announces-implementation-visa-sanctions-four-countries .

On March 15, one day before President Trump\u2019s revised executive order was slated to go into effect, the U.S. District Court in Hawaii issued a nationwide temporary block preventing the government from enforcing or implementing Section 2 (90-day travel ban) and Section 6 (120-day U.S. refugee program suspension) of the revised order. Also, early on March 16, the U.S. District Court in Maryland issued a separate ruling barring enforcement nationwide of the 90-day travel ban. Other sections of the revised executive order not included in the court\u2019s decision became effective at\u00a012:01 a.m. ET\u00a0on March 16, including Section 5 (uniform screening and vetting standards for all immigration programs), Section 7 (rescission of exercise of authority relating to terrorism grounds of inadmissibility), Section 8 (expedited completion of biometric entry-exit tracking system), Section 9 (visa interview security), and Section 10 (visa validity reciprocity). The U.S. Department of State announced that due to the litigation, U.S. embassies and consulates will continue to process visas for nationals of the six targeted countries. Nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen may continue to travel into the U.S. for the immediate future, if otherwise admissible. The university continues to follow the situation closely and will update this page as further information becomes available. Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions. March 8, 2017 President Trump has signed a\u00a0revised executive order\u00a0that will suspend the entry of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for a period of 90 days beginning March 16 at 12:01 a.m. ET. The new order rescinds the president\u2019s Jan. 27 travel ban, which a federal court suspended last month. The new travel restrictions will be in effect through June 14, 2017.\u00a0However, the order indicates that ban could be extended and additional countries could be subject to restrictions. Who is subject to the revised executive order? The executive order prohibits nationals of the six restricted countries from entering the United States unless they qualify for an exemption or are granted a waiver. Iraqi nationals are no longer included in the ban.\u00a0The order also suspends the admission of refugees from any country, including Syria, for 120 days as of March 16. The following classes of foreign nationals will be exempt from the ban: U.S. lawful permanent residents (green card holders) Holders of a valid U.S. visa, even if they have not yet used it (Visas that were provisionally revoked under the Jan. 27 executive order should be valid for travel. Foreign nationals with a visa that was physically cancelled under the Jan. 27 executive order may be entitled to a new travel document for entry to the U.S.) Dual nationals traveling on a valid passport from a non-restricted country\u00a0(Dual nationals must hold a valid U.S. visa or be visa-exempt.) Foreign nationals holding a valid advance parole document Foreign nationals holding a valid A, C-2, G, or NATO visa Foreign nationals granted asylum Refugees already admitted to the U.S. and those with travel formally scheduled by the State Department Once the order is in effect, non-exempt nationals of the restricted countries will be prohibited from entering the U.S. for the duration of the ban unless they are granted a waiver. Until the new executive order takes effect, the Department of State indicates that it will continue to process visa applications from nationals of the six restricted countries.\u00a0However, applicants should be prepared for lengthy security screening and the possibility that they may not be issued a visa before the entry ban takes effect. Waivers of the entry ban The executive order permits the Departments of Homeland Security and State to grant discretionary waivers of the entry ban. Waiver applicants must show that a denial of entry would cause undue hardship and that their entry is in the national interest and would not pose a threat to national security . The executive order suggests that a waiver may be appropriate for several classes of foreign nationals, including: (1) individuals previously admitted to the U.S. for a continuous period of work, study, or another long-term activity who are seeking to resume that activity; (2) individuals with previously established significant contacts with the U.S.; (3) individuals with significant business or professional obligations in the U.S.; (4) individuals seeking to visit or reside with a close family member; (5) individuals who are infants, young children or adoptees, or needing urgent medical care, or otherwise justified by the special circumstances; (6) individuals employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government; (7) individuals who are permanent Canadian residents applying for a visa in Canada; and (8) individuals traveling as a U.S. government-sponsored exchange visitor.\u00a0Given the stringent criteria, however, waivers may be difficult to obtain. Processing of immigration applications and petitions The executive order limits the Department of State interview waiver program for nonimmigrant visa applicants.\u00a0Though foreign nationals from non-restricted countries may still qualify for an exemption from an in-person visa interview, visa applicants should check the website of the relevant U.S. consulate for specific information, which is subject to frequent change. In addition to the entry ban, the president has issued a memorandum directing the Departments of Homeland Security, State, and Justice to implement more stringent vetting of applications and petitions for immigration benefits. Enhanced security screening could take effect quickly, and may delay processing at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and at U.S. consulates. February 27, 2017 \u2013 Immigration Executive Orders: Your Rights & the Current Climate ISEC, 102 COLUMBUS AVENUE, 3pm Megan Kludt, Esq. of Curran & Berger LLP will be the featured speaker.

The Department of Homeland Security has directed its agency to adjudicate applications and petitions filed for or on behalf of individuals in the U.S., regardless of their country of origin. Also, all U.S. ports of entry will resume admission of non-immigrant and immigrant visa holders, including refugees, according to policies and procedures existing prior to the Executive Order. The Court of Appeals instructed attorneys for each party to file briefs by 11 a.m. on Thursday, Feb. 16, arguing whether the government\u2019s motion for a stay should be considered again by the entire appeals court. To hold a rehearing, a majority of the 29 active judges on the court would need to vote in favor of that motion. We will continue to provide updates on the pending litigation. Please contact the Office of Global Services or We Care if you have any questions. February 5, 2017 \u2013President Aoun\u2019s Statement \u201cTo all members of the Northeastern University community: For the past decade, we have joined together to make Northeastern a truly global university. In doing so, we have set forth a series of\u00a0core values\u00a0such as the value of inclusivity and a bedrock belief that diversity makes our community stronger. I find the president\u2019s executive order restricting international travel to be antithetical to our core values and completely unacceptable. I say this as an educator and as an American who came to this country as an international student. Throughout the past week, I have had the opportunity to speak to many in our community who are directly affected by this new reality. I have listened to their stories and seen the anxiety etched in their faces. To the 250 Northeastern students and 31 faculty and staff impacted by this executive order: Your story is my story. You have my unwavering pledge that your university will stand by you, safeguard you, and be your home away from home. To my faculty and staff colleagues: Ensuring that all in our community can achieve their dreams without disruption is our highest priority. It is an honor to work with you on this charge. As we all know, Northeastern never stands idly by, observing from the sidelines. On Friday, we joined seven other leading universities in filing an\u00a0amicus\u00a0brief in federal court. Our brief makes clear that the executive order imperils our ability to have students and scholars collaborate and advance knowledge across borders. The order represents a threat to the mission of global higher education. In the aftermath of this executive order, it has become abundantly clear that the integration of diverse people, ideas, and cultures\u2014which universities like Northeastern make possible\u2014is more important than ever before. Let us turn this challenge into opportunity. Together, we will seize this moment to reaffirm our core values and strengthen our commitment to being a diverse, inclusive, and truly global university. I look forward to achieving this important work together. Sincerely, Joseph E. Aoun President\u201d February 5, 2017 \u2013 Events planned for Community Members Affected by the Executive Order Lunch Invite: Invitation to Students, Scholars, and Faculty for Community Members Affected by the Executive Order Tuesday, Feb. 7, 1-3 p.m., Curry Student Center Ballroom It has been a stressful week and we would like to invite everyone to come together. The Office of Global Services invites you to join us for an informal catered lunch where we will provide informal updates about campus support services and information on upcoming events. Click here to register Understanding the Executive Order and Implications for Our Community Wednesday, Feb. 8, 10-11:30 a.m., Curry Student Center Ballroom Faculty and staff from Northeastern\u2019s School of Law, Office of General Counsel, Office of Global Services, as well as local immigration attorneys will provide an overview of what the Executive Order is, the implications behind the stay, the appeal process, and what this all means for Northeastern community members. The panel will discuss the differences between status adjustments (such as program extension or CPT) at the university level versus adjudications that need to be done by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. February 4, 2017 \u2013 US Citizenship and Immigration Services Update For students concerned about applying for Optional Practical Training (OPT), the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services continues to adjudicate applications and petitions filed on behalf of individuals in the United States regardless of their country of origin, and applications and petitions of lawful permanent residents outside the U.S. Applications to adjust status also continue to be adjudicated, according to existing policies and procedures, for applicants who are nationals of countries designated in the Jan. 27, 2017, \u201c Executive Order: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States .\u201d February 4, 2017 \u2013 No Current Plans to Expand Travel Ban Beyond Current Countries The Department of State confirmed that there is no addendum, annex, or amendment now being worked on to expand visa revocations or the travel ban to countries other than those currently implicated in the Executive Order. February 4, 2017 \u2013 Clarification from DHS and DOS re: Implementation of Executive Order on Immigration On Friday, Feb. 3, and effective immediately, a federal judge in Seattle issued a ruling that temporarily blocks President Trump\u2019s week-old immigration order from being enforced nationwide. Following the decision, the Department of Homeland Security said it has suspended all actions to implement the president\u2019s immigration order. The department will resume inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the executive order, according to a DHS statement. Meanwhile, the State Department said it has reversed the cancellation of visas that were provisionally revoked following the travel ban\u2014so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled. According to Customs and Border Protection, individuals who had their visas physically canceled as a result of the executive order will not need to reapply for a new visa. Absent any other admissibility issues, those individuals will receive an I-193 waiver (Application for Waiver of Passport and/or Visa) upon arrival to the U.S. For those traveling by air, airlines have been instructed to contact Customs and Border Protection to receive authorization to permit boarding. On Sunday, Feb. 5, a federal appeals court rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore the executive order. We continue to monitor all legal and implementation decisions related to the executive order and will provide information as it becomes available. February 1, 2017 \u2013 Travel Alert Under President Trump\u2019s Immigration Executive Order On January 27, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order suspending immigrant and non-immigrant admissions to the U.S. for at least 90 days for individuals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The Executive Order did not specifically categorize what categories of \u201cindividuals\u201d (i.e., the definition of \u201c individuals from \u201d) are subject to the ban. This broad generalization has led to widespread confusion at ports of entry across the U.S., but since then the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has stated that travelers will be treated according to the travel document (passport) they present at the border. See https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/29/protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states Federal judges in several jurisdictions issued court rulings to stay the terms of the Executive Order that would have led to the removal of foreign nationals who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa or status as a lawful permanent resident (green card holder). These stays remain in effect but may be temporary. These court orders also do not apply to airports with pre-clearance facilities (Dublin & Shannon, Ireland; Aruba; Freeport & Nassau, The Bahamas; Bermuda; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and Calgary, Toronto, Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver, and Winnipeg, Canada). Nationals of the seven affected countries should avoid flying into the U.S. from these airports. These court orders do not mean that anyone arriving with a visa is guaranteed entry. People with a non-immigrant (temporary) visa from those 7 countries will be denied entry unless they can show that their admission is in the national interest and they do not pose a security threat. Citizens of the affected countries who hold dual citizenship with the U.S. should not be directly affected. Non-U.S. citizens who hold dual citizenship with the affected countries and one other foreign country may be subject to the ban. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant deemed a threat to national security or public safety. This ban may include individuals who have traveled to one or more of the designated countries as well, even if they do not hold a nationality of one of the designated countries. Additional screening for those who have been in these countries should be expected, including the search and examination of luggage, mobile phones, computers, and electronics, including social media pages for any anti-American communications or posts. Green card holders returning to the U.S. after a short time abroad have the legal right to return to the U.S., barring exceptional circumstances. On January 29, 2017, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security released a statement that \u201cthe entry of lawful permanent residents\u201d is in the national interest. Further, U.S. Embassies and Consulates across the world have been instructed not to issue any non-immigrant or immigrant visas to persons from the affected countries, consistent with the Executive Order. Also, individuals from one of the affected countries who have a pending immigration petition or application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may experience delays in the adjudication of their cases. The Executive Order also contemplates that additional countries could be added to the banned list.\u00a0 Accordingly, until more information becomes available, and given the possibility of a change in government policy that could go into effect immediately, all foreign nationals should carefully assess whether it is worth the risk to travel outside the United States. We recommend that international students and scholars should not travel outside of the U.S. without speaking with an advisor at the Office of Global Services (OGS) and/or seeking advice from personal legal counsel who can review individual circumstances for potential available options or possible relief from the consequences of the Executive Order. The OGS can provide you with a list of personal immigration attorneys and a list of pro bono service providers. The OGS is working with offices and key stakeholders throughout the university to offer resources and support for international students and scholars.

These definitions align with the Northeastern University\u2019s defined instructional methods. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In person (Traditional): All engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Hybrid: The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Remote (Online): The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer\u2019s physical location Per federal regulations, F-1 international students must maintain on-ground presence during every required academic term of study to maintain nonimmigrant student status. This includes any required term when a student is engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization.\u202fWith these defined methods, the Office of Global Services (OGS) has updated the maintenance of status policy for F-1 students engaging in remote practical experiences. Starting Fall 2024, during required academic terms, F-1 students engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning while authorized for CPT must maintain their non-immigrant status with on-ground presence by either: Engaging on-site (in person) at the designated employer\u2019s location. This can be in-person or hybrid, as defined above. Engaging remotely with the designated employer with simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course. Students should enroll in an on-ground course stipulated by their academic program, which must run for the duration of the required academic term. Students should work with their academic department/advisor to identify a course that is appropriate. Co-op students only : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements. If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor. If an F-1 student withdraws from (W grade) or fails to attend (NE grade) their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training/experiential learning, it will be a violation of status based on failure to maintain on-ground presence . The student\u2019s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated which may impact eligibility for other F-1 benefits, including but not limited to Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (Post-OPT). F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above.

The USCIS update resolves the confusion created by the August policy update and aligns with the Student and Exchange Visitor Program\u2019s (SEVP) longstanding guidance allowing exceptions to the five-month rule for F-1 students participating in authorized study abroad programs. Therefore, students may continue to engage in a temporary absence abroad that exceeds 5 months if it is an approved academic activity and it is reported to the Office of Global Services (OGS). Approved academic activities abroad for F-1 students include study abroad, global co-op, or research abroad. Northeastern University and other institutions, alongside professional international education organizations, advocated for clarity and alignment of federal guidance. We are pleased to see this positive resolution and will continue to monitor related developments. If you have questions about your F-1 status or upcoming plans to return to the U.S. after an absence of more than five months, please contact OGS for guidance and support. Original October 8, 2024 Alert Federal regulations state that students in F-1 status maintain nonimmigrant status as long as they return to the U.S. after a temporary absence of five months or less [8 CFR 214.2(f)(4)]. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) allows an exception to the 5-month rule for F-1 students enrolled in an authorized study abroad program. On August 27, 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a Policy Alert announcing a new interpretation of the Five-Month Temporary Absence Rule for F-1 students. The USCIS alert has created confusion as it conflicts with the SEVP\u2019s long-standing agency guidance. Professional international education organizations and institutes of higher education, including Northeastern University, are actively engaged in advocacy efforts to seek clarification in support of F-1 students enrolled in approved academic activities abroad. In the interim, if you are a Northeastern student who has been outside of the U.S. for more than five months due to study abroad, global co-op, or research abroad, please contact OGS ( Contact \u2013 Office of Global Services ) to request a letter of support for re-entry into the U.S. as a proactive measure.

Any citizens of a country that was subject to a travel ban in the past may want to be particularly cautious about international travel in the coming months. Anyone who holds an Advanced Parole re-entry document (rather than a valid visa) and has discretionary protection (rather than legal status) may want to re-consider travel abroad. International students, faculty, and staff who are not citizens of a country subject to a past travel ban, and who have a valid U.S. visa, face fewer risks when traveling internationally.

Important Note about Visa Renewals Please note that receiving an initial F-1/J-1 visa does not guarantee that your visa will be renewed in the future.

Approval Congratulations! The majority of F-1/J-1 visa renewal applications are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you. Denials 214(b) Denial Although F-1/J-1 visa denials are rare during visa renewal applications, the most common visa denial is under 214(b). This means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have nonimmigrant intent and/or did not fully show they have sufficient ties to their home country\u2014such as family, job, education, or property\u2014indicating they will not immigrate to the U.S. Students are expected to return home after completing their studies and any qualifying periods of Optional Practical Training (OPT) or Academic Training (AT). The F-1/J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer\u2019s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your F-1/J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1/J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. PP 10043 Denial On May 29, 2020, a Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China\u2019s \u201cmilitary-civil fusion strategy.\u201d This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected. Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations. If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance. Students should review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials. Administrative Processing Please note that if you received a 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your initial visa application, it is probable that you will receive another 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your visa renewal application. We encourage students to consult with OGS directly if they have received a 221(g) notice in the past prior to departing the U.S. to attempt to renew their visa. The outcome of some visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as \u201c Administrative Processing .\u201d Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months. In these cases, the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. You should follow the instructions listed on the 221(g) notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS\u00a0by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance. What is \u201cAdministrative Processing\u201d? After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including: Your country of birth or citizenship Academic or employment history, including military experience Travel history Source of funding Past U.S. immigration records Family members\u2019 backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence Geopolitical factors These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn\u2019t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields. Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa. Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process. If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment. Next Steps During Administrative Processing If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process.

This usually aligns with your I-20/DS-2019 program end date, or after you have completed all degree requirements, whichever is sooner. If you finish degree requirements before your I-20/DS-2019 end date, you must notify OGS so that your document can be updated, as your grace period and eligibility for certain benefits are based on your program completion. During the grace period, students can remain in the U.S. to travel or prepare to depart the U.S. Any on-campus employment must stop as of the I-20/DS-2019 program end date.

Failure to maintain normal academic progress and academic standing may result in academic probation, dismissal, suspension or other negative consequences which may impact your ability to maintain full-time enrollment and your F-1/J-1 status. If you are academically dismissed, please review the OGS website and contact OGS as soon as possible to discuss your options. Please be sure to reach out for academic support early and often if you are experiencing challenges with coursework. Maintain Full-Time Enrollment You must maintain full-time enrollment each academic term (except during designated vacation periods) and make continuous academic progress towards the completion of your program of study. Full-time enrollment is as follows: Undergraduate: minimum of 12 credit hours per term Graduate: minimum of 8 credit hours per term (9 credit hours per term in a 3-credit enrollment system) Graduate students who hold an assistantship: minimum of 6 credit hours per term International students enrolled in NU Immerse/Global Pathways must follow the requirements of their programs Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS) The same rules regarding maintaining full-time enrollment, as explained above, apply to F-1 students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS), but there are important differences in program delivery. Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in two sessions (A and B) but still count as one full academic term. CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on-ground courses throughout the entire term. For instance, F-1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term. F-1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility! Maintain On-Ground Presence in Classes Students must maintain on-ground presence throughout the academic term. At Northeastern, there are four different defined instructional methods: Traditional, Hybrid, Live Cast, and Online. Traditional, Hybrid, and Live Cast courses meet the F-1 on-ground presence requirements. Online courses do not meet the F-1 on-ground presence requirements. You can learn more about the Defined Instructional Methods at Northeastern on the Registrar\u2019s website. Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS) Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in one of two sessions (A and B) throughout the academic term. CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on-ground courses throughout the entire term. For instance, F-1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term. F-1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility! Maintain On-Ground Presence when Authorized for Curricular Practical Training (F-1 students) F-1 students must maintain on-ground presence while pursuing practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) Authorization. On-ground presence is a key component and requirement of F-1 nonimmigrant status and must be maintained during all required terms. Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during vacation periods. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In Person (Traditional) : All engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Hybrid : The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Remote (Online) : The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer\u2019s physical location To learn more about maintaining on-ground presence when authorized for CPT, please visit this webpage. Understand Limitations to Enrolling in Online Courses F-1 students have strict limitations to online course enrollment imposed by the U.S. federal government. In general, within minimum full-time credit requirements , F-1 students may be eligible to take a maximum of: one 3-credit online course, or one 4-credit online course in a 4-credit enrollment system or up to three credits total for 1-credit courses, for example, three 1-credit courses, or one 2-credit course and one 1-credit course Enrolling in two 2-credit online courses is not acceptable and considered a violation of F-1 status Students in NU Immerse/Global Pathways are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements Once F-1 students have met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements, they may enroll in additional online courses if needed/desired. J-1 students are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements. It is important that all F-1 and J-1 students contact their academic advisor before enrolling in online courses or withdrawing from any courses, so that they can make an informed decision about their enrollment. Understand Limitations on Reduced Course Loads With minor exceptions for non-required summer terms and your final term , you must maintain full-time enrollment and should not drop below a full-time course load unless you have received authorization from OGS in advance. You are not eligible for a reduced course load or a non-medical leave of absence without receiving prior authorization from OGS. Authorization must be obtained before the start of the term or before dropping any course(s) that would drop below full-time enrollment. Please see sections on reduced course load and leaves of absence for more information on these topics. Request a Leave of Absence in Advance If you need to take a Medical Leave of Absence or a Personal Leave of Absence , you must submit requests to both the University and OGS in advance . Do not drop or withdraw from your classes without final approval from OGS. There is no retroactive leave of absence authorization for students who drop classes without being approved for a leave. Follow Requirements for Study Abroad, Global Co-op, and Research Abroad Study Abroad and Global Co-op : If you are participating in a university-approved study abroad experience through the Global Experience Office or a university-approved Global Co-op, you must report your academic activities abroad to OGS. You are required to maintain full-time enrollment in order to maintain your F-1/J-1 student status while participating in approved academic activities abroad. Any changes in enrollment during your program could affect your ability to return to the U.S . Research Abroad : To be approved by OGS for research abroad, you must maintain your full-time registration status at Northeastern University. Additionally, your overseas research project must be required to complete your degree . Please refer to the Study Abroad, Research Abroad, and Global Co-op page of the OGS website for more information. Notify OGS of Any Change in Program or Degree Level in Advance If you are a current, continuing student at Northeastern and you will be starting a new program at Northeastern, you must submit a Change of Degree Level (CDL) e-form to OGS prior to starting the new program . This does not apply to undergraduate students who are changing majors. Please review OGS\u2019 CDL webpage for more information and instructions: Change of Degree Level \u2013 officeofglobalservices (northeastern.edu) Notify OGS of Any Change of Major in Advance If you are a current, continuing undergraduate student at Northeastern and you will be 1) changing your major or 2) declaring your major, you must submit a I-20 of DS-2019 Request for Continuing Students e-form to OGS prior to starting the new program . This applies to students in the Explore Program and the General Studies Program. Once your request is reviewed and processed by OGS, you will receive a new I-20 with the same SEVIS ID number reflecting the new program information. You will not be required to submit an Immigration Clearance again for this new degree. If you are currently in a Master\u2019s program and you are c hanging from one Master\u2019s degree program to another Master\u2019s degree program (either after completing the first, or without completing), please see Change of Degree Level information above. Transferring to Another U.S. School If you are an F-1 student who would like to transfer your SEVIS record from Northeastern University to another SEVP-certified institution, you should review the Transferring Out page of the OGS website and must submit a transfer out request to OGS so that we can release your SEVIS record. To have your SEVIS record transferred to your new institution, you must continue to maintain your F-1 student status until the transfer release date. You may request that our office transfer your SEVIS record prior to the end of your program at Northeastern, but the date that your new university receives your record should occur after you have completed your program or after your last date of attendance. If you have already completed your program, your transfer out date must occur within your 60-day grace period. Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree/Program Early F-1 students in their final term (even if it is earlier than their current I-20 end date) should review the Final Term page of the OGS website and submit the Intent to Complete e-form linked on that page. Your I-20/DS-2019 end date must correspond with your final term of enrollment. Therefore, if you will finish your program before your I-20/DS-2019 end date you must notify OGS so we can shorten your I-20/DS-2019 to reflect the term in which you completed all requirements for graduation. Remaining in the U.S. without full-time enrollment or taking other action to maintain/extend status even if your I-20/DS-2019 has an end date in the future is not considered maintaining status. If you are in your final term and are planning on applying for post-completion OPT or AT, your program end date will be adjusted accordingly if needed when OGS processes your request. Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree/Program Later Than Expected If you need additional time to complete your degree requirements, beyond your current I-20 or DS-2019 end date, you must apply for a Program Extension. To maintain your status, you must apply for this extension before your current I-20 or DS-2019 program end date . You can find more information about the Program Extension process on the OGS website. Intentionally failing classes to extend your I-20/DS-2019 is not a legitimate reason for a program extension and may be a violation of academic integrity policies which may impact your F-1/J-1 status.", "tests": {"What are the minimum credit hours required for full-time enrollment for undergraduate students?": "Undergraduate students must maintain a minimum of 12 credit hours per term.", "Can F-1 students take online courses?": "F-1 students may take online courses, but generally, they can enroll in a maximum of one 3-credit online course or one 4-credit online course in a 4-credit enrollment system, only after meeting minimum full-time on-ground requirements.", "What should I do if I am experiencing challenges with coursework?": "You should reach out for academic support early and often if you are experiencing challenges with coursework.", "What happens if I drop below full-time enrollment without authorization?": "No Answer"}}, {"document": "J-1 Student Requirements Please note that the requirements below are specific to students with J-1 status, who were issued a Form DS-2019.

If you purchased health insurance in your home country, please ensure that it covers all of the requirements listed above. OGS is not able to review individual plans to ensure they comply with these requirements. Please contact your health insurance provider to confirm your plan meets all requirements. The Northeastern Student Health Insurance Plan (NUSHP) meets the Department of State requirements. If your health insurance plan does not cover repatriation & medical evacuation, there are supplemental plans you can purchase to meet this requirement, including this plan offered by Gallagher Student Health & Special Risk. Willful non-compliance with this requirement would be a violation of your J-1 status and may result in termination of your SEVIS record. Matriculation & Changing Degree Level J- 1 degree -seeking students may be eligible to continue their program at a higher degree level through a process called \u201cMatriculation.\u201d This is only permissible to move t o ah higher degree level, for example \u2013 Bachelor \u2018s to Master\u2019s o r Master \u2019s to Doctorate/PhD. If you are in the J-1 n on-degree student category, you are not eligible for Matriculation as that would require a change of your J-1 category. Two-Year Home Residence Requirement (212e) Some J-1 are subject to the two-year home country physical presence requirement. It requires you to return home for at least two years after your exchange visitor program ends. You can check your visa stamp and consular-processed DS-2019 to see whether you are subject. Please read the OGS website for more information to understand this requirement and contact OGS if you have questions. 12- and 24-Month Bars The 12- and 24-month bars are different from the two-year home country residence requirement. The 12- and 24-month rule affects J-1 exchange visitors who have been in the U.S. inJ-1 status previously, and wish to return, using the J-1 Research Scholar. If you are in the J-1 degree student category and have a program length longer than 6 months, please note that you will automatically become subject to the 12-month bar.

If you\u2019re based on the Boston campus, to correct an I-94 card/record or passport stamp in person, go to Logan International Airport \u2013 Terminal E and look for the Customs and Border Protection Office.

Take all of your original immigration documentation with you to this office and explain why you believe there is an error on your I-94 card, I-94 electronic record, or passport admission stamp, and ask for their assistance in having the error corrected. If you are seeking correction to the I-94 card/record, or passport stamp of your dependent spouse or child, then your dependent must accompany you to the Deferred Inspection Office. Your dependent must take all of their original immigration documents with them. Option #2: Requesting an I-94 Correction by E-Mail NOTE : Corrections to a paper Form I-94 card or passport stamp can only be done in person. Going to the CBP Deferred Inspection Office is also advisable for time-sensitive situations, as e-mail requests are handled only after all in-person cases are resolved. However, if your passport admission stamp is correct, and there is an error on your Form I-94 electronic record, you may be eligible to request a correction of your Form I-94 record.

They may also ask you some basic questions. Provide truthful answers and ask for clarification if needed. Be sure to tell the CBP officer that you will be studying at Northeastern University as an F-1 student, or a J-1 exchange visitor when you present your I-20 and F-1 visa or DS-2019 and J-1 visa. Remember that an F-1/J-1 visa is a travel document that allows you to request entry/admission into the U.S. as an international student. CBP ha s final authority to grant or deny entry and may conduct a full review of your documentation showing full-time enrollment and financial ability to study in the U.S. For more information about CBP Immigration Inspection, visit their website about clearing customs . There are many items that cannot be brought into the U.S. or that need to be declared upon entry. Please check out the Customs and Border Protection Website for more information. You will be issued an electronic I-94, which indicates your nonimmigrant status in the U.S, which should be F-1 student status or J-1 exchange visitor status. Generally, this step should not last more than a few minutes. Until recently, visa holders received an entry stamp in their passports, and the CBP officers noted D/S (Duration of Status) on\u00a0F-1 and J-1 visa passport pages; this meant you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the length of time indicated on your I-20 or DS-2019, provided that you maintain full-time enrollment and a valid F-1/J-1 visa status. Many U.S. airports have\u00a0discontinued stamping passports with an entry stamp when entering the U.S. Instead, each time you enter the U.S., the CBP creates an online, electronic entry record to record your entry into the U.S. This is called your I-94 record (Scroll down to read Check Your I-94 Record for more information). If everything is in order, the CBP officer will return all of your documentation they inspected, and you can proceed to collect any checked luggage and/or transfer.\u00a0Ensure that you have collected all of your belongings before exiting the immigration inspection area. If the officer has additional questions, you may be directed to Secondary Inspection.
