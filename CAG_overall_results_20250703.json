Please note that Visiting Appointments (Visiting Students, Visiting Scholars, and Visiting Faculty) are NOT benefits-eligible . If you are a benefits-eligible employee, and plan to enroll in NU health benefits, please note that the high deductible Northeastern health insurance plan does NOT meet the J-1 insurance deductible requirement ($500 per accident/illness). J-1 scholars should NOT enroll in the high deductible plan. Please note that the Northeastern health insurance plans do not cover repatriation or medical evacuation . J-1 Scholars will either have to purchase repatriation and medical evacuation insurance separately or select a health insurance plan through a provider other than Northeastern (see next section below). An affordable plan for just repatriation/medical evacuation coverage is available here . If your appointment start date is not on the first day of the month, please note that your Northeastern health insurance plan may not go into effect until the following month.

Co-op students only : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements. If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor. Part-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization F-1 Students engaged remotely in part-time practical training/experiential learning must couple their part-time practical experience course enrollment with only on-ground courses to meet both the on-ground requirement and the full-time status requirement. As such, students engaging in part-time co-ops are not eligible to maintain their on-ground presence through the EXED course and may not enroll in online classes to meet the minimum credit requirements for the term. Experiential Learning with an Overseas Employer with CPT Authorization F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain their on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above. Failure to Maintain On-Ground Presence If an F-1 student withdraws from or fails to attend their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training, it will be considered a violation of status and the student\u2019s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated. Regardless of the modality of the practical experience, students need regular engagement with both the practical training provider as well as the academic program to confirm successful progression of the practical training experience. Travel during Experiential Learning Engaging on-site at your employer\u2019s physical location or participating in a university designated on-ground course is a mandatory to maintain the on-ground presence required by your F-1 student status. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term, as their F-1 status and academic goals may be negatively impacted. In cases where travel outside of the U.S. cannot be avoided, we highly recommend that students limit their absence from the U.S. and in-person classes as much as possible. If students choose to travel during a required term, they are taking on the associated risks, including but not limited to scrutiny by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) upon re-entry to the U.S. as well as scrutiny when applying for future immigration status or benefits.",

The more common method of gaining J-1 status (as outlined in the first sections of this page) is through traveling and re-entering the U.S. in your new J-1 visa status. In this case, you must apply for a J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad. Applying at the local Embassy/Consulate in your home country is recommended. You can enter the U.S. no earlier than 30 days before the DS-2019 program start date. Depending on your situation, you may prefer to leave the U.S. to obtain the J-1 visa instead of proceeding with the change of status process in the U.S. If you currently hold C, D, K, WB or WT status, you are not eligible to change to any other status within the U.S., including J-1. If you or your family are currently in J status (including J-2) and you are subject to the Two-Year Foreign Residency Requirement INA 212(e) , you may not change status in the U.S. unless you have been granted a waiver. USCIS processing times for adjudication of change of status applications to J-1 are 4-8 months depending on the processing center. We stron g ly recommend filing \u201c premium processing \u201d (which includes an additional $1,750 fee) to expedite the adjudication of your change of status application to ensure you can start your J-1 program on time. PLEASE NOTE: The Office of Global Services (OGS) can provide genera l information regarding the process, requirements, and timeline for an I-539 change of status application, however, since this is your personal immigration application, we cannot assist with detailed question or assist you in filing the application. We recommend consulting with an experienced immigration attorney if you require assistance filing your application beyond the general information provided on this page. DS-2019 Request Process You will follow the same steps outlined in the first section on this page to confirm your appointment at Northeastern and initiate a DS-2019 request to OGS. Once you have received your DS-2019 from OGS, you may begin the process of submitting your change of status application to USCIS. Required Documents To request a change to J-1 status, you must submit the following documents to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) : A completed USCIS Form I-539 (and Form I-539 Supplement if you have a spouse and/or dependents who will change to J-2 status). See here for filing instructions . Filing fee of $370: You can pay the fee with a money order, personal check, cashier\u2019s check, or pay by credit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions . If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. OPTIONAL: Premium Processin g \u2013 if you would like to pay an additional fee for premium processing to request that USCIS to provide a decision on your application within 15 days, you will need to submit the $1,750 I-907 premium processing fee. Photocopy of SEVIS fee payment receipt. Photocopy of the Form DS-2019 issued to you and all dependents, properly signed by you. Photocopy of your and any dependent family members\u2019 I-94 record from www.cbp.gov/i94 . Photocopy of information page of your passport (and of each dependent included in the application). Please note: Do not send your original passport. Photocopy of the visa that you used to enter the United States. If there are J-2 dependent applicants, you must submit evidence of their relationship to you (example: birth or marriage certificate with English translation). You must provide evidence of residence abroad or other evidence proving ties to your home country. Proof of financial support matching the source and funding amount listed on your DS-2019 for the entire duration of your J-1 program for you and your dependents. How to File Your Application The filing location for your Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, depends on your filing classification and where you live. You should use the filing address listed on the USCIS website in the \u201cNonimmigrants and Their Dependents\u201d dropdown menu. If you are requesting premium processing service for Form I-539, you must also file Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service , and review the \u201c Where to File \u201d section on that page. After Applying for Change of Status Once you have submitted your change of status application to USCIS, please email your receipt notice and approval notice once your petition is approved to [email\u00a0protected] . Travel Considerations : You will abandon or cancel a pending change of status application by departing the U.S. while the petition is pending. Please also note that a change of status within the U.S. grants you J-1 status to remain in the U.S. and start/continue your J-1 program, however it does not grant you a J-1 visa stamp. If you travel internationally after approval of the J-1 change of status, you will need to apply for the J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad in order to re-enter the U.S. to continue your J-1 program. Review the OGS website for visa application information and travel guidance . Once your change of status is approved, follow the instructions in emails from OGS for viewing the J-1 scholar orientation and completing your researcher confirmation of arrival e-form. If your plans change or you abandon your change of status application, please email [email\u00a0protected] . Important Information Maintaining Status : You must also maintain your current status while your change of status application is pending. Failure to do so may result in USCIS denying your change of status application. If a change of status application is not approved before the requested start date on your Form DS-2019, we must defer your start date to avoid SEVIS record cancellation. If the deferred start date is later than the expiration of your current nonimmigrant status, you may have to extend your current status; this is known as a \u201cbridge\u201d extension. We recommend that you consult an experienced immigration lawyer with questions about procedures and maintenance of status (including the need to file a bridge extension) during the pendency of a change of status application. I-901 SEVIS Fee : All exchange visitors must pay a SEVIS (I-901) fee before applying for a J-1 visa or acquiring J-1 status. If you are a Canadian citizen exempt from the visa requirement, you must still pay this fee prior to submitting your change of status application. You will need Northeastern University\u2019s Exchange Visitor Program Number to complete the Form I-901. The number is: P-1-03057. It is important that you have a receipt for the SEVIS fee payment before applying to change your status in the United States, as you will be required to submit this receipt with your change of status application. *For payment options or for details go to https://www.fmjfee.com/i901fee/index.html . F-1 Visa Holders on Post-Completion or STEM Extension OPT : there are important considerations with the timing of your change from F-1 to J-1 in this circumstance. Please consult with OGS at [email\u00a0protected] for advising.",

For current F/J Students and Scholars, an I-20 travel signature and DS-2019 travel endorsement are valid for 12-months (or until the document\u2019s expiration date, whichever is sooner).

                "doc": "Visa Application Outcomes Please note that if you do not receive your F-1 visa prior to the start of your program, you may be advised to defer your admission to a future term. Approval Congratulations! The majority of F-1 visa applicants are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you. Denials 214(b) Denial Although F-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their students and any qualifying periods of post-completion OPT or STEM OPT. The F-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer\u2019s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when an F-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your F-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. PP 10043 Denial On May 29, 2020, a Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China\u2019s \u201cmilitary-civil fusion strategy.\u201d This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected. Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations. If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance. Students should review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials. Administrative Processing The outcome of some F-1 visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as \u201c Administrative Processing .\u201d Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months. In these cases, the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. You should follow the instructions listed on the 221(g) notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS\u00a0by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance. What is \u201cAdministrative Processing\u201d? After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including: Your country of birth or citizenship Academic or employment history, including military experience Travel history Source of funding Past U.S. immigration records Family members\u2019 backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence Geopolitical factors These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn\u2019t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields. Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa. Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process. If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment. Next Steps During Administrative Processing If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process. Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing.",

It is also good practice to have a letter of invitation ready to provide to border officers at ports of entry upon arrival in Canada to help demonstrate purpose of entry. This applies to all visitors if someone is inviting them, including visitors from visa exempt countries. A letter of invitation does not guarantee that Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will issue a visa or that Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) will allow entry into Canada. Visa officers assess the applications to decide whether the person invited meets the terms of Canada\u2019s immigration laws. Similarly, border officers at ports of entry will consider all the relevant factors in accordance with Canada\u2019s immigration laws, including purpose of entry in making the decision to allow entry.

Cultural and educational exchange are the primary purpose of this visa program. To learn more about the J Exchange Visitor Program, please read the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Welcome Brochure or Bridge USA J-1 Student Page which summarizes many of your rights. You can find contact information for the U.S. Department of State below. Telephone: +1-(866)-283-9090 Email: [email\u00a0protected] Maintain Full-Time Enrollment & On-Ground Presence If you are in the J-1 student degree category (bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, doctorate) and enrolled in a full-time degree program, the same requirements above in the \u201cStudy Requirements\u201d section regarding full-time enrollment and maintaining on-ground presence apply to you. You may only count one online class towards your full-time enrollment requirement . Once you have met the full-time, on-ground enrollment requirement, you are eligible to take additional online classes that exceed your minimum credit requirements. Maintain Health Insurance Coverage U.S. government regulations [22 CFR \u00a7 62.14] require all J-1 students and J-2 dependents to obtain health insurance that meets the following requirements: Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness Payment for repatriation (preparation and transportation of remains to home country) in case of death in the amount of $25,000 Payment for medical evacuation (transportation to home country on advice of attending physician) in the amount of $50,000 A deductible amount not to exceed $500 per accident or illness Coverage of pre-existing conditions after a reasonable waiting period Payment by the insurance company of at least 75% of the costs of medical care (the patient must not be required to pay more than 25% of medical care costs) Continuous coverage for the duration of the program To comply with these regulations, health insurance policies must be underwritten by corporations having one of the following: A.M. Best rating of A- or above McGraw Hill Financial/Standard & Poor\u2019s Claims- paying Ability rating of \u2018A- or above Weiss Research, Inc. rating of \u2018\u2018B+\u2019\u2019 or above Fitch Ratings, Inc. rating of \u2018\u2018A-\u2019\u2019 or above Moody\u2019s Investor Services rating of \u2018\u2018A3\u2019\u2019 or above. Note: Insurance backed by the full faith and credit of the exchange visitor \u2018s (J-1 scholar\u2019s) government meets this requirement. If you purchased health insurance in your home country, please ensure that it covers all of the requirements listed above. OGS is not able to review individual plans to ensure they comply with these requirements. Please contact your health insurance provider to confirm your plan meets all requirements. The Northeastern Student Health Insurance Plan (NUSHP) meets the Department of State requirements. If your health insurance plan does not cover repatriation & medical evacuation, there are supplemental plans you can purchase to meet this requirement, including this plan offered by Gallagher Student Health & Special Risk. Willful non-compliance with this requirement would be a violation of your J-1 status and may result in termination of your SEVIS record. Matriculation & Changing Degree Level J- 1 degree -seeking students may be eligible to continue their program at a higher degree level through a process called \u201cMatriculation.\u201d This is only permissible to move t o ah higher degree level, for example \u2013 Bachelor \u2018s to Master\u2019s o r Master \u2019s to Doctorate/PhD. If you are in the J-1 n on-degree student category, you are not eligible for Matriculation as that would require a change of your J-1 category. Two-Year Home Residence Requirement (212e) Some J-1 are subject to the two-year home country physical presence requirement. It requires you to return home for at least two years after your exchange visitor program ends. You can check your visa stamp and consular-processed DS-2019 to see whether you are subject. Please read the OGS website for more information to understand this requirement and contact OGS if you have questions. 12- and 24-Month Bars The 12- and 24-month bars are different from the two-year home country residence requirement. The 12- and 24-month rule affects J-1 exchange visitors who have been in the U.S. inJ-1 status previously, and wish to return, using the J-1 Research Scholar. If you are in the J-1 degree student category and have a program length longer than 6 months, please note that you will automatically become subject to the 12-month bar. This will only impact your ability to return to the U.S. in the J-1 Research Scholar/Professor categories for 12 months (commonly used for Visiting Scholars/Researchers/Professors and Postdoctoral Fellows).

Approval Congratulations! The majority of F-1/J-1 visa renewal applications are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you. Denials 214(b) Denial Although F-1/J-1 visa denials are rare during visa renewal applications, the most common visa denial is under 214(b). This means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have nonimmigrant intent and/or did not fully show they have sufficient ties to their home country\u2014such as family, job, education, or property\u2014indicating they will not immigrate to the U.S. Students are expected to return home after completing their studies and any qualifying periods of Optional Practical Training (OPT) or Academic Training (AT). The F-1/J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer\u2019s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your F-1/J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1/J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. PP 10043 Denial On May 29, 2020, a Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China\u2019s \u201cmilitary-civil fusion strategy.\u201d This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected. Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations. If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance. Students should review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials. Administrative Processing Please note that if you received a 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your initial visa application, it is probable that you will receive another 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your visa renewal application. We encourage students to consult with OGS directly if they have received a 221(g) notice in the past prior to departing the U.S. to attempt to renew their visa. The outcome of some visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as \u201c Administrative Processing .\u201d Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months. In these cases, the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. You should follow the instructions listed on the 221(g) notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS\u00a0by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance. What is \u201cAdministrative Processing\u201d? After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including: Your country of birth or citizenship Academic or employment history, including military experience Travel history Source of funding Past U.S. immigration records Family members\u2019 backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence Geopolitical factors These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn\u2019t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields. Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa. Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process. If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment. Next Steps During Administrative Processing If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process. Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing.",

The students who receive mentorship are called \u201cmentees.\u201d Participating new students will be matched with an OGS Global Student Mentor. The mentor will reach out first via Qooper to introduce themselves and set up the first meeting. Throughout the academic term, mentees will connect with their mentor in person through 1-1 meetings, small group sessions, and group gatherings. Small group meetings take place in-person at least once per month. Mentees can ask questions and receive advice from the perspective of an experienced Northeastern student. Mentors will help their mentees set goals and make steps toward completing these goals throughout the first semester at Northeastern.

Our office will send any important information related to your F-1/J-1 status to your Northeastern email address . Please add the OGS email address to your approved senders list in your Northeastern email account and frequently check your junk/spam folders for any missed emails from OGS. Failure to read an important email from OGS will not be an acceptable excuse to the Department of Homeland Security for failing to maintain your F-1/J-1 status . Report Any U.S. Address or Phone Number Changes F-1 and J-1 regulations require that you report any change to your U.S. phone number or U.S. local address within 10 days of the change . OGS is then required to report this change on your behalf in your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record. These changes are not reflected on your I-20/DS-2019 and do not require issuance of a new document. Currently enrolled students should update this information in their Student Hub account. Graduated students on post-completion OPT, STEM OPT, or AT should report their address update either in the SEVP portal or in myOGS. Keep Copies of all Immigration-Related Documents (I-20s, DS-2019s, etc.) OGS does not retain signed copies of your immigration documents, as it is your responsibility to maintain a record of these documents. Save each immigration document you are issued during your F-1/J-1 status. You may need them in the future: to document your employment history and your compliance with U.S. immigration regulations for applications for immigration benefits to U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) or future visa applications to Department of State For electronically issued I-20s, you must print and sign at the bottom of Page 1. We recommend you take a photo or scan a PDF of the signed document. Students on the STEM OPT Extension : please keep copies of all fully executed Forms I-983 that you complete with your STEM employers (including all 12-month and final evaluations on Page 5). J-1 students : please print and sign each digitally-signed DS-2019 that is issued to you. We recommend you keep copies of all DS-2019s issued to you either as paper documents or digitally-signed documents. Report Changes to Your Immigration Status Report any changes in your non-immigrant status from F-1/J-1 to any other status to OGS. You can report a change to becoming a permanent resident (green card holder) using this e-form . If your non-immigrant status changes to H-1B, you can submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form . Attend the School Listed on Page 1 of your Form I-20 (F-1 Students) or DS-2019 (J-1 Students) Submit the Mandatory Immigration Clearance Immediately Upon Arrival in the U.S. at the Start of your Program All international students with F-1 or J-1 status must complete the mandatory Immigration Clearance at the start of each new program of study. This is a U.S. government regulation for students to maintain their non-immigrant status. OGS facilitates this process, which is called \u201conline immigration clearance.\u201d Students who do not complete the mandatory immigration clearance within the deadline are not maintaining status and are at risk of SEVIS record termination. Students will receive emails regarding Immigration Clearance before the start of their academic program and can find more information regarding this process on the OGS website . Keep Your Immigration Documents Accurate and Up to Date Keep your passport valid at all times. The passport must be valid for at least 6 months into the future on the day you return to the U.S. from a trip abroad. Your F-1/J-1 visa may expire while you are inside the U.S. You only need to renew your F-1/J-1 visa if you are going to travel outside of the U.S. and need to return. Keep your I-20 or DS-2019 valid and accurate at all times and understand your end date. Remember that your I-20/DS-2019 is essentially a printout of your SEVIS record, and if things change, you must notify OGS so that the document can be updated . Extend your I-20 prior to its expiration date if you are unable to complete your academic program by the original end date. In the event of change of academic program or level, update your I-20 in a timely fashion in accordance with immigration regulations (see the \u201cChange of Degree Level\u201d section below) Notify OGS if you decide to finish your degree online from overseas, stop your program earlier than anticipated , or end an authorized period of CPT/OPT/STEM OPT earlier than anticipated and depart the U.S. Understand Your \u201cGrace Period\u201d After Program Completion F-1 and J-1 students enter what is called a \u201cgrace period\u201d after they have completed their degree programs. This usually aligns with your I-20/DS-2019 program end date, or after you have completed all degree requirements, whichever is sooner. If you finish degree requirements before your I-20/DS-2019 end date, you must notify OGS so that your document can be updated, as your grace period and eligibility for certain benefits are based on your program completion. During the grace period, students can remain in the U.S. to travel or prepare to depart the U.S. Any on-campus employment must stop as of the I-20/DS-2019 program end date. F-1 Students : F-1 students who successfully complete their program are granted a 60-day grace period starting the day after their I-20 program end date. During the 60-day grace period, F-1 students are eligible for the following: To remain in the U.S. for traveling and preparing to depart the U.S. To request a change of degree level. To apply for post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT). To request a transfer if admitted to another SEVP-certified institution. During the 60-day grace period, F-1 students are NOT eligible for the following: Program extension: if you have remaining degree requirements after your I-20 program end date, you must request extension before the end date. J-1 Students : J-1 students who successfully complete their program are granted a 30-day grace period starting the day after their DS-2019 program end date. During the 30-day grace period, J-1 students are only eligible for the following: To remain in the U.S. for traveling and preparing to depart the U.S. During the 30-day grace period, J-1 students are NOT eligible for the following: To request to transfer to another U.S. institution. To apply for post-completion Academic Training (AT) \u2013 this must be requested prior to your DS-2019 end date. To request to begin a new degree program at Northeastern while remaining in the U.S. through \u201cmatriculation.\u201d If you have not requested OPT/AT, a change of degree level, or received approval to transfer out, and you depart the U.S. during the grace period, your SEVIS record will be completed and you are no longer eligible to re-enter on your current I-20 or DS-2019.",

If you decide to renew your F-1/J-1 visa in a country other than your country of citizenship, OGS strongly recommends that you plan ahead as visa issuance is always discretionary. Current students are also advised to establish a back up plan in the event that they are unable to return to the U.S. in a timely manner to participate in courses/practical training/research in person.

Please note that this is not a visa denial. Additionally, for J-1 scholars conducting research in certain STEM fields, your application may undergo additional security screening as part of administrative processing. This can often take several months and it is difficult to get updates from the Embassy during that time. You should follow the instructions on the 221(g) to provide any requested information or documentation. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, or if the 221(g) will delay your arrival to the U.S. to start your J-1 program, please contact [email\u00a0protected] . Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing. Visa Denials Although J-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their J-1 program. The J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer\u2019s questions, and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a J-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. You can apply again for the J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa refusals and visa denials.

(Click each topic below for more information) Understand J-1 Student Status The J-1 Exchange Visitor Program is administered by the U.S. Department of State and was created in 1961 to \u201c\u2026promote mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries by means of educational and cultural exchange [\u2026]\u201d. Cultural and educational exchange are the primary purpose of this visa program. To learn more about the J Exchange Visitor Program, please read the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Welcome Brochure or Bridge USA J-1 Student Page which summarizes many of your rights. You can find contact information for the U.S. Department of State below. Telephone: +1-(866)-283-9090 Email: [email\u00a0protected] Maintain Full-Time Enrollment & On-Ground Presence If you are in the J-1 student degree category (bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, doctorate) and enrolled in a full-time degree program, the same requirements above in the \u201cStudy Requirements\u201d section regarding full-time enrollment and maintaining on-ground presence apply to you. You may only count one online class towards your full-time enrollment requirement . Once you have met the full-time, on-ground enrollment requirement, you are eligible to take additional online classes that exceed your minimum credit requirements. Maintain Health Insurance Coverage U.S. government regulations [22 CFR \u00a7 62.14] require all J-1 students and J-2 dependents to obtain health insurance that meets the following requirements: Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness Payment for repatriation (preparation and transportation of remains to home country) in case of death in the amount of $25,000 Payment for medical evacuation (transportation to home country on advice of attending physician) in the amount of $50,000 A deductible amount not to exceed $500 per accident or illness Coverage of pre-existing conditions after a reasonable waiting period Payment by the insurance company of at least 75% of the costs of medical care (the patient must not be required to pay more than 25% of medical care costs) Continuous coverage for the duration of the program To comply with these regulations, health insurance policies must be underwritten by corporations having one of the following: A.M. Best rating of A- or above McGraw Hill Financial/Standard & Poor\u2019s Claims- paying Ability rating of \u2018A- or above Weiss Research, Inc. rating of \u2018\u2018B+\u2019\u2019 or above Fitch Ratings, Inc. rating of \u2018\u2018A-\u2019\u2019 or above Moody\u2019s Investor Services rating of \u2018\u2018A3\u2019\u2019 or above. Note: Insurance backed by the full faith and credit of the exchange visitor \u2018s (J-1 scholar\u2019s) government meets this requirement. If you purchased health insurance in your home country, please ensure that it covers all of the requirements listed above. OGS is not able to review individual plans to ensure they comply with these requirements. Please contact your health insurance provider to confirm your plan meets all requirements. The Northeastern Student Health Insurance Plan (NUSHP) meets the Department of State requirements. If your health insurance plan does not cover repatriation & medical evacuation, there are supplemental plans you can purchase to meet this requirement, including this plan offered by Gallagher Student Health & Special Risk. Willful non-compliance with this requirement would be a violation of your J-1 status and may result in termination of your SEVIS record. Matriculation & Changing Degree Level J- 1 degree -seeking students may be eligible to continue their program at a higher degree level through a process called \u201cMatriculation.\u201d This is only permissible to move t o ah higher degree level, for example \u2013 Bachelor \u2018s to Master\u2019s o r Master \u2019s to Doctorate/PhD. If you are in the J-1 n on-degree student category, you are not eligible for Matriculation as that would require a change of your J-1 category. Two-Year Home Residence Requirement (212e) Some J-1 are subject to the two-year home country physical presence requirement. It requires you to return home for at least two years after your exchange visitor program ends. You can check your visa stamp and consular-processed DS-2019 to see whether you are subject. Please read the OGS website for more information to understand this requirement and contact OGS if you have questions. 12- and 24-Month Bars The 12- and 24-month bars are different from the two-year home country residence requirement. The 12- and 24-month rule affects J-1 exchange visitors who have been in the U.S. inJ-1 status previously, and wish to return, using the J-1 Research Scholar. If you are in the J-1 degree student category and have a program length longer than 6 months, please note that you will automatically become subject to the 12-month bar. This will only impact your ability to return to the U.S. in the J-1 Research Scholar/Professor categories for 12 months (commonly used for Visiting Scholars/Researchers/Professors and Postdoctoral Fellows). Please review the OGS website for more information about the bars.",

                "doc": "F-1 and J-1 Study Requirements (Click each topic below for more information) Make Normal Academic Progress and Stay in Good Academic Standing Review the academic requirements, academic policies, and minimum GPA requirements of your academic program and adhere to all requirements. Failure to maintain normal academic progress and academic standing may result in academic probation, dismissal, suspension or other negative consequences which may impact your ability to maintain full-time enrollment and your F-1/J-1 status. If you are academically dismissed, please review the OGS website and contact OGS as soon as possible to discuss your options. Please be sure to reach out for academic support early and often if you are experiencing challenges with coursework. Maintain Full-Time Enrollment You must maintain full-time enrollment each academic term (except during designated vacation periods) and make continuous academic progress towards the completion of your program of study. Full-time enrollment is as follows: Undergraduate: minimum of 12 credit hours per term Graduate: minimum of 8 credit hours per term (9 credit hours per term in a 3-credit enrollment system) Graduate students who hold an assistantship: minimum of 6 credit hours per term International students enrolled in NU Immerse/Global Pathways must follow the requirements of their programs Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS) The same rules regarding maintaining full-time enrollment, as explained above, apply to F-1 students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS), but there are important differences in program delivery. Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in two sessions (A and B) but still count as one full academic term. CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on-ground courses throughout the entire term. For instance, F-1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term. F-1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility! Maintain On-Ground Presence in Classes Students must maintain on-ground presence throughout the academic term. At Northeastern, there are four different defined instructional methods: Traditional, Hybrid, Live Cast, and Online. Traditional, Hybrid, and Live Cast courses meet the F-1 on-ground presence requirements. Online courses do not meet the F-1 on-ground presence requirements. You can learn more about the Defined Instructional Methods at Northeastern on the Registrar\u2019s website. Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS) Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in one of two sessions (A and B) throughout the academic term. CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on-ground courses throughout the entire term. For instance, F-1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term. F-1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility! Maintain On-Ground Presence when Authorized for Curricular Practical Training (F-1 students) F-1 students must maintain on-ground presence while pursuing practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) Authorization. On-ground presence is a key component and requirement of F-1 nonimmigrant status and must be maintained during all required terms. Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during vacation periods. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In Person (Traditional) : All engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Hybrid : The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Remote (Online) : The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer\u2019s physical location To learn more about maintaining on-ground presence when authorized for CPT, please visit this webpage. Understand Limitations to Enrolling in Online Courses F-1 students have strict limitations to online course enrollment imposed by the U.S. federal government. In general, within minimum full-time credit requirements , F-1 students may be eligible to take a maximum of: one 3-credit online course, or one 4-credit online course in a 4-credit enrollment system or up to three credits total for 1-credit courses, for example, three 1-credit courses, or one 2-credit course and one 1-credit course Enrolling in two 2-credit online courses is not acceptable and considered a violation of F-1 status Students in NU Immerse/Global Pathways are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements Once F-1 students have met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements, they may enroll in additional online courses if needed/desired. J-1 students are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements. It is important that all F-1 and J-1 students contact their academic advisor before enrolling in online courses or withdrawing from any courses, so that they can make an informed decision about their enrollment. Understand Limitations on Reduced Course Loads With minor exceptions for non-required summer terms and your final term , you must maintain full-time enrollment and should not drop below a full-time course load unless you have received authorization from OGS in advance. You are not eligible for a reduced course load or a non-medical leave of absence without receiving prior authorization from OGS. Authorization must be obtained before the start of the term or before dropping any course(s) that would drop below full-time enrollment. Please see sections on reduced course load and leaves of absence for more information on these topics. Request a Leave of Absence in Advance If you need to take a Medical Leave of Absence or a Personal Leave of Absence , you must submit requests to both the University and OGS in advance . Do not drop or withdraw from your classes without final approval from OGS. There is no retroactive leave of absence authorization for students who drop classes without being approved for a leave. Follow Requirements for Study Abroad, Global Co-op, and Research Abroad Study Abroad and Global Co-op : If you are participating in a university-approved study abroad experience through the Global Experience Office or a university-approved Global Co-op, you must report your academic activities abroad to OGS. You are required to maintain full-time enrollment in order to maintain your F-1/J-1 student status while participating in approved academic activities abroad. Any changes in enrollment during your program could affect your ability to return to the U.S . Research Abroad : To be approved by OGS for research abroad, you must maintain your full-time registration status at Northeastern University. Additionally, your overseas research project must be required to complete your degree . Please refer to the Study Abroad, Research Abroad, and Global Co-op page of the OGS website for more information. Notify OGS of Any Change in Program or Degree Level in Advance If you are a current, continuing student at Northeastern and you will be starting a new program at Northeastern, you must submit a Change of Degree Level (CDL) e-form to OGS prior to starting the new program . This does not apply to undergraduate students who are changing majors. Please review OGS\u2019 CDL webpage for more information and instructions: Change of Degree Level \u2013 officeofglobalservices (northeastern.edu) Notify OGS of Any Change of Major in Advance If you are a current, continuing undergraduate student at Northeastern and you will be 1) changing your major or 2) declaring your major, you must submit a I-20 of DS-2019 Request for Continuing Students e-form to OGS prior to starting the new program . This applies to students in the Explore Program and the General Studies Program. Once your request is reviewed and processed by OGS, you will receive a new I-20 with the same SEVIS ID number reflecting the new program information. You will not be required to submit an Immigration Clearance again for this new degree. If you are currently in a Master\u2019s program and you are c hanging from one Master\u2019s degree program to another Master\u2019s degree program (either after completing the first, or without completing), please see Change of Degree Level information above. Transferring to Another U.S. School If you are an F-1 student who would like to transfer your SEVIS record from Northeastern University to another SEVP-certified institution, you should review the Transferring Out page of the OGS website and must submit a transfer out request to OGS so that we can release your SEVIS record. To have your SEVIS record transferred to your new institution, you must continue to maintain your F-1 student status until the transfer release date. You may request that our office transfer your SEVIS record prior to the end of your program at Northeastern, but the date that your new university receives your record should occur after you have completed your program or after your last date of attendance. If you have already completed your program, your transfer out date must occur within your 60-day grace period. Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree/Program Early F-1 students in their final term (even if it is earlier than their current I-20 end date) should review the Final Term page of the OGS website and submit the Intent to Complete e-form linked on that page. Your I-20/DS-2019 end date must correspond with your final term of enrollment. Therefore, if you will finish your program before your I-20/DS-2019 end date you must notify OGS so we can shorten your I-20/DS-2019 to reflect the term in which you completed all requirements for graduation. Remaining in the U.S. without full-time enrollment or taking other action to maintain/extend status even if your I-20/DS-2019 has an end date in the future is not considered maintaining status. If you are in your final term and are planning on applying for post-completion OPT or AT, your program end date will be adjusted accordingly if needed when OGS processes your request. Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree/Program Later Than Expected If you need additional time to complete your degree requirements, beyond your current I-20 or DS-2019 end date, you must apply for a Program Extension. To maintain your status, you must apply for this extension before your current I-20 or DS-2019 program end date . You can find more information about the Program Extension process on the OGS website. Intentionally failing classes to extend your I-20/DS-2019 is not a legitimate reason for a program extension and may be a violation of academic integrity policies which may impact your F-1/J-1 status.",

Approval Congratulations! The majority of F-1/J-1 visa renewal applications are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you. Denials 214(b) Denial Although F-1/J-1 visa denials are rare during visa renewal applications, the most common visa denial is under 214(b). This means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have nonimmigrant intent and/or did not fully show they have sufficient ties to their home country\u2014such as family, job, education, or property\u2014indicating they will not immigrate to the U.S. Students are expected to return home after completing their studies and any qualifying periods of Optional Practical Training (OPT) or Academic Training (AT). The F-1/J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer\u2019s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your F-1/J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1/J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. PP 10043 Denial On May 29, 2020, a Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China\u2019s \u201cmilitary-civil fusion strategy.\u201d This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected. Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations. If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance. Students should review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials. Administrative Processing Please note that if you received a 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your initial visa application, it is probable that you will receive another 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your visa renewal application. We encourage students to consult with OGS directly if they have received a 221(g) notice in the past prior to departing the U.S. to attempt to renew their visa. The outcome of some visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as \u201c Administrative Processing .\u201d Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months. In these cases, the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. You should follow the instructions listed on the 221(g) notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS\u00a0by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance. What is \u201cAdministrative Processing\u201d? After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including: Your country of birth or citizenship Academic or employment history, including military experience Travel history Source of funding Past U.S. immigration records Family members\u2019 backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence Geopolitical factors These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn\u2019t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields. Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa. Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process. If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment. Next Steps During Administrative Processing If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process. Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing.",
