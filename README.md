Project Description:
This project aims to develop an AI-powered chatbot that enables international students to efficiently access information from Northeastern’s Office of Global Services website using natural language queries. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG), the chatbot will provide accurate, context-aware responses with citations.
A key challenge is the website’s complex structure, making it difficult for users to find relevant information. The solution involves automated web scraping to extract and preprocess content, ensuring up-to-date responses without manual intervention. The chatbot will be deployed locally first, with plans for cloud deployment for broader accessibility.
The project also serves as a learning opportunity for web scraping, NLP model fine-tuning, and cloud-based deployment, enhancing the technical skills of the development team
