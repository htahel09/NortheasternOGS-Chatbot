However, not all students are required or choose to study during the summer term. Whether you plan to study or travel, it is important to maintain your status in the summer. You can learn more below. Summer Enrollment at Northeastern During required academic terms, F-1 and J-1 students must maintain full-time enrollment and appropriate on-ground presence. While the summer term is considered a vacation term for most continuing students, some students are required to maintain full-time enrollment in the summer. Please read the following information carefully to make sure you understand your summer enrollment requirements. What summer terms are available at Northeastern? CPS Undergraduate students and School of Law Students Full Summer CPS Graduate Students Summer Quarter All other Undergraduate and Graduate students Full Summer Summer 1* Summer 2* *Degree-seeking students that are eligible to enroll in summer 1 only or summer 2 only may enroll in half of their typical full-time enrollment requirement (6 credits for undergraduate students and 4 credits for graduate students). When do students have to maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence during the summer? You are required to maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence during the summer term(s) if: It is your first term of enrollment at NU and you have an Initial or Transfer I-20/DS-2019 It is your first term of enrollment after an approved change of degree level (CDL) or change of status (COS) It is your final academic term It is required for all students in your degree program You are returning to NU after a leave of absence You are a PhD student receiving university funding (SGA, Fellowship, etc.) If you are required to maintain full-time enrollment during the summer term you must follow all requirements found on the Maintaining Status page of the OGS website If you are required to maintain full-time enrollment during the summer term and have been offered on-campus employment or have received a Stipended Graduate Assistantship (SGA) , you may not work more than 20 hours/week Summer enrollment in your first term If the summer term is your first term of enrollment at Northeastern, you are correcting status and have an Initial I-20/DS-2019, or it is your first term after an approved Change of Degree Level (CDL) or Change of Status (COS), you must maintain full-time enrollment and appropriate on-ground presence for the duration of the summer term(s). Enrollment in on-ground courses must occur during all parts of the term.

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe United States F-1 Curricular Practical Training (CPT) Curricular Practical Training (CPT) is a benefit for eligible F-1 students to authorize approved experiential learning that takes place in the U.S. or with a U.S. based employer. Understanding Curricular Practical Training (CPT) CPT is a form of curricular training authorization available for eligible F-1 students during their program of study for experiential learning opportunities that are necessary and integral, or required, as part of an academic program at Northeastern University. CPT authorization must be obtained for every co-op, internship, practicum, clinical rotation, corporate residency, experiential PhD, or other approved experiential learning opportunity CPT authorization is required prior to the intended start date of the experiential learning , whether or not the activity takes place on-campus or off-campus CPT can be either full-time (more than 20 hours per week) or part-time (20 hours or less per week) CPT can be either paid or unpaid CPT is employer, location, full-time/part-time, and date specific. The employer’s name, address and the precise start and end dates must be authorized by OGS in advance Students must maintain on-ground presence during every required term of study. This includes any required term when a student is authorized for CPT Once authorized for CPT, F-1 students must comply with the authorization granted. Any extensions, cancellations, or changes to authorized CPT must be first approved by the academic advisor/co-op coordinator and OGS. Non-curricular based on-campus activities (commonly referred to as “on-campus employment”) do not require CPT authorization. If you have any questions about how this applies to you, please contact OGS. If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff/faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern, please review this guidance from Northeastern’s University Office of General Counsel. Eligibility Requirements In order to be eligible for CPT, students must meet all of the following requirements Comply with all college academic and enrollment eligibility requirements and policies for experiential learning This includes every co-op, internship, practicum, clinical rotation, corporate residency, experiential PhD, or other experiential learning opportunity, whether the activity takes place on-campus or off-campus Enroll in a course that requires an experiential learning component in the syllabus. This will usually be a Co-op course or another program-required course Enrollment must be maintained for the entire period of authorized CPT Complete at least one academic year as a full-time, degree-seeking student with an active SEVIS record* One academic year is defined as two semesters or three quarters while maintaining on-ground presence Time spent in Prematriculation and Pathway programs (including N.U.in, Foundation Year, NU Immerse, Global Scholars, and Global Pathways) will not accrue time toward CPT eligibility. Students enrolled in such programs will only begin to accrue time toward CPT eligibility once they have fully matriculated into a degree-seeking program *Limited exceptions to the completion of one academic year may apply in the following circumstances: For students in graduate-level programs that require immediate participation in experiential learning for program completion For students who completed one academic year in another visa status or institution changed to F-1 status within the U.S. or by travel and re-entry, who otherwise qualify Change of Status and SEVIS Transfer Students please review “Change of Status and Transfer Students” below for more information Maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence during every required term of study Review the OGS Guidelines on Maintaining Status for more information A huge part of your responsibility of maintaining your F-1 status is by actively participating in your academic activities in person. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term. As an international student, this prolonged absence may impact your F-1 status and your long-term academic goals as well as future immigration benefits. Make normal progress towards degree completion CPT authorization must not cause a delay in the completion of a student’s academic program Maintaining On-Ground Presence when Authorized for CPT F-1 international students must maintain on-ground presence during every required academic term of study to maintain nonimmigrant student status . This includes any required term when a student is engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization. Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during non-required terms. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In person (Traditional): All engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Hybrid: The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Remote (Online): The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer’s physical location Full-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization To maintain on-ground presence during a required term while pursuing full-time experiential learning, students have the following options: Option 1 : Engaging on-site (in person) at the employer’s physical location. This can be in-person or hybrid, as defined above Students will be maintaining on-ground presence based on their engagement with the employer Option 2 : Engaging remotely with the employer with simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course Students should enroll in an on-ground course stipulated by their academic program, which must run for the duration of the required academic term. Students should work with their academic department/advisor/co-op advisor to identify a course that is appropriate. Co-op students only : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements. If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor. Part-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization F-1 Students engaged remotely in part-time practical training/experiential learning must couple their part-time practical experience course enrollment with only on-ground courses to meet both the on-ground requirement and the full-time status requirement. As such, students engaging in part-time co-ops are not eligible to maintain their on-ground presence through the EXED course and may not enroll in online classes to meet the minimum credit requirements for the term. Experiential Learning with an Overseas Employer with CPT Authorization F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain their on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above. Failure to Maintain On-Ground Presence If an F-1 student withdraws from or fails to attend their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training, it will be considered a violation of status and the student’s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated. Regardless of the modality of the practical experience, students need regular engagement with both the practical training provider as well as the academic program to confirm successful progression of the practical training experience. Travel during Experiential Learning Engaging on-site at your employer’s physical location or participating in a university designated on-ground course is a mandatory to maintain the on-ground presence required by your F-1 student status. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term, as their F-1 status and academic goals may be negatively impacted. In cases where travel outside of the U.S. cannot be avoided, we highly recommend that students limit their absence from the U.S. and in-person classes as much as possible. If students choose to travel during a required term, they are taking on the associated risks, including but not limited to scrutiny by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) upon re-entry to the U.S. as well as scrutiny when applying for future immigration status or benefits. Application Process To participate in an experiential learning opportunity in the U.S., F-1 students must obtain CPT authorization from OGS. All CPT requests must first be academically reviewed, approved, and determined to be integral or required for degree completion, by the appropriate advisor, co-op coordinator, or authorized secondary approver. Step 1: Student completes the CPT Authorization Request e-form The student must fill out the CPT Authorization Request e-form. The documents the student will need include: Electronic I-94 (“Class of Admission” must be F-1 and “Admit Until Date” must indicate “D/S”) Passport identity page that is valid at least until the start date of the CPT authorization When the student has submitted the e-form it will be routed to the secondary approver as indicated in the e-form. Step 2: Secondary approver reviews student's CPT e-form submission The Authorized Secondary Approver (CPT) who receives the request will review the information the student has entered and determine if they approve it academically as either integral or required for program completion. If approved, the Authorized Secondary Approver will submit the request to OGS. If the Authorized Secondary Approver does not approve of the request, they will email the student directly regarding their decision. See below for Authorized Secondary Approver Lists : Undergraduate Students Graduate Students Step 3: OGS reviews completed CPT e-form submission Upon receipt of the completed e-form from the Secondary Approver, OGS will review the CPT request within 15 business days. OGS will examine the student’s documents to determine if they meet all F-1 eligibility requirements for CPT. OGS may place the request on hold and email the student/advisor for more information or approve/deny the CPT request. Step 4: Student receives updated I-20 with CPT recommendation If your CPT request is approved, a Designated School Official (DSO) from OGS will send the I-20 electronically to your Northeastern University email. You are advised to: Review your I-20 to ensure all information is accurate and complete Print and sign your I-20 Only work within the listed start and end dates on your I-20 Updating or changing your CPT authorization While on CPT, any updates, extensions, changes, or cancellations to your employment must be reported to and approved both by your academic/co-op advisor and by a DSO in OGS. These changes include: Employer Location Date Number of hours worked per week (full-time/part-time) Cancellations Other corrections Once authorized for CPT, F-1 students must comply with the authorization granted. How CPT affects OPT Eligibility If an F-1 student exceeds 364 days of full-time CPT (more than 20 hours per week at a degree level—bachelor’s, master’s or doctorate), they will lose their eligibility to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) at that degree level. Part-time CPT (20 hours per week or less) does not accrue time towards the 364-day calculation. When counting CPT days, every day between the start and end date of CPT is included (including the start and end dates). The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization, not the days the student actually worked. This means even if it was a weekend, holiday, vacation etc., it still counts if the student had CPT authorization. It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full-time CPT days have been used per degree level. Students can use previously issued I-20s to document this. Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this e-form . As a reminder, CPT is a benefit of F-1 status, not a guarantee. While students may be able to work up to 364 days while maintaining OPT eligibility, CPT authorization is directly tied to a student’s academic curriculum. Therefore, the amount of CPT for which students are eligible and may be authorized is entirely based on their program of study, as well as F-1 federal regulations. Simply because an F-1 student has not engaged in 364 days of full-time CPT does not necessarily mean the student is eligible for additional CPT or an extension of a current CPT authorization. Change of Status and SEVIS Transfer Students Change of Status Students Full-time students who have applied to change their immigration status to F-1 within the U.S. (application through USICS) or by traveling (via consular processing) may be eligible to use time from a previous immigration status towards accruing benefits, such as CPT, as long as the student has previously maintained full-time enrollment requirements. Please contact OGS to make an appointment with a DSO to discuss CPT eligibility and bring all applicable documentation with you (e.g. official transcripts, a copy of your I-797 approval notice if you changed status within the U.S.). SEVIS Transfer Students International students with Active F-1 records who transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University may be eligible to use enrolled time at the previous institution towards the one academic year requirement for CPT eligibility. Please contact OGS to make an appointment with a DSO to discuss CPT eligibility and have all applicable documentation available (e.g. official transcripts and your previous I-20) Key Resources CPT Authorization Request Form » This e-form is to request authorization for Curricular Practical Training.

The Office of Global Services will only authorize CPT in a student’s final term if the practical training experience is required for degree completion. Can I request CPT authorization for my independent study course? Independent study courses do not qualify for CPT authorization. Do I need CPT authorization for an internship or co-op that is unpaid? Yes! All work associated with an experiential learning opportunity requires CPT authorization, even if it is unpaid. Is there a limit to the number of hours per week I can work while authorized for CPT? In order to know the answer to this, you will need to understand what kind of CPT authorization you have. You can find this information on the second page of your I-20. If your I-20 states you have part-time CPT, then this means you can never exceed 20 hours per week. If your I-20 states you have full-time CPT, then this means there is no limit to the number of hours per week you can work. However, you must always check with your advisor or co-op coordinator to see if they have a limit to the number of hours per week you can work. Do I need CPT authorization for training dates that occur prior to employment? Yes, all training dates require prior CPT authorization. Remember, even time spend while you are not being paid requires CPT authorization. How will I know if I have received CPT authorization? You will know if you have CPT authorization by checking the second page of your most recent I-20. On the second page of your I-20, you will see all the details of your employment authorization. Can I take additional courses while I'm participating in a co-op/internship/clinical rotation? If you would like to enroll in courses while you are participating in a co-op/internship/clinical rotation, you must check with your co-op department or advisor to see if there are academic or university restrictions that would prevent you from doing so. Can I have an on-campus job while I am authorized for CPT during a co-op/internship/clinical rotation? Yes, students are allowed to work on-campus while they also have CPT. However, students are not allowed to work on an SGA (Stipended Graduate Assistantship) and be authorized for CPT for a paid experience at the same time. Please keep in mind that some colleges may not allow you to work on-campus and be on coop at the same time or may have restrictions on how much on-campus employment is allowed while on coop. If this is the case, you will need to follow your co-op department’s rules. My employer offered to extend my co-op/internship on a part-time basis. Can I do this? If your employer offers to extend your co-op/internship on a part-time basis, you must inquire with your academic department to determine if the extension is curricular and is integral to your course of study. If it is determined that the continuation of your co-op/internship is integral to your course of study, you may be eligible to request CPT authorization again. If the continuation of the co-op/internship is not supported academically, you may be eligible to apply for Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training (Pre-OPT). Does part-time CPT count towards the 364 day mark that affects my OPT eligibility? No, part-time CPT authorization does not count towards the 364 days of authorization that would impact OPT eligibility. How can I find out how much CPT time I've used? You can calculate how much CPT time you’ve used by looking at past I-20s. You can also request documentation of your previous CPT authorizations from OGS by filling out the following e-form. Do I need CPT authorization if Northeastern is my employer during co-op/internship/clinical rotation? Students must be authorized for CPT for any experiential learning they conduct, on- or off-campus, paid or unpaid. Students who pursue experiential learning with Northeastern as their employer require CPT authorization. Can I end my CPT earlier than the original end date? Students must consult with their co-op and/or academic advisor if there will be any changes to their approved Co-op/CPT employment in order to ensure that all academic requirements will be met (this link is specific to Co-op requirements). Then, students must follow up with OGS by completing the CPT Update E-form to report changes to OGS in order to receive an updated I-20. How do I find who my authorized secondary approver for CPT is? Authorized secondary approvers are often co-op coordinators or academic advisors for programs that involve experiential learning other than co-op. The lists of authorized secondary approvers for CPT can be found here: Undergraduate students Graduate students I am pursuing a double/combined major. How do I know if my opportunity is eligible for CPT? Students are only eligible for CPT authorization if their opportunity is directly related to their major area of study. For students with double or combined majors, the opportunity may be related to either major. This criteria is confirmed by the students authorized secondary approver, as they have the required understanding about student’s major/curriculum to make this determination.Students Studying in \n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe United States Volunteering and Unpaid Internships Northeastern University values experiential learning and serving our communities.  While volunteering may seem simple, it is actually a complex area in which immigration regulations and labor laws intersect. Complexities of volunteering If you are interested in volunteering, you must be aware of relevant F-1 and J-1 regulations, so you and the organization do not violate any rules regarding employment authorization. F-1 and J-1 students who are working off-campus must be authorized before engaging in the employment. Without proper authorization, off-campus employment, including some volunteering, would be considered a violation of your F-1 or J-1 requirements. The consequences may include loss of your F-1 or J-1 status in the U.S.—making it difficult to reacquire lawful status within the U.S. If you are considering engaging in a volunteering opportunity, please make an appointment with an OGS adviser before making plans to begin any activity. Volunteering vs. Unpaid Internship There is a difference between volunteering and engaging in an unpaid internship. Volunteering refers to donating time with an organization whose primary purpose is charitable or humanitarian in nature, without remuneration or any other type of compensation. F-1 and J-1 students are allowed to engage in volunteer work as long as it meets this stated criteria. For example, it is permitted for F-1 and J-1 students to volunteer at a local homeless shelter, charitable food pantry, or American Red Cross. Unpaid internships, on the other hand, do not usually qualify as “volunteer” activity. Internships, both paid and unpaid, are primarily offered by the private sector and related to the intern’s major field of study. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students are advised to seek work authorization prior in order to engage in unpaid internships. The Department of Labor in the U.S. has guidelines for those seeking an unpaid internship, please see here , the “Primary Beneficiary Test” outlined on the Department of Labor’s website can be used to determine whether or not the unpaid internship is considered employment. Because of the consequences of unauthorized employment, we caution all F-1 and J-1 students to consult the Office of Global Services when considering engaging in an unpaid internship or volunteering opportunity. Please make an appointment with an OGS advisor before making plans to begin any activity. U.S. Department of Labor's definition volunteering The Department of Labor is concerned both with the protection of jobs for U.S citizens, and with the prevention of exploitation of workers. They have created laws to ensure employment that should be paid is not done for free. While both you and the employer may be happy with an unpaid arrangement (for example, you may be eager to work even on an unpaid basis in a company in order to gain job experience), this may be considered an unfair arrangement in cases where the work is normally performed by a paid person and both the company and the employee are benefiting from the employment. How to determine whether an activity is truly volunteering and does NOT require work authorization Employment authorization is NOT required when the work performed can be considered volunteering. To be considered volunteering, the work performed by the individual must meet the following criteria: No compensation or expectation of compensation The volunteer cannot displace a genuine employee and the services provided by the volunteer should not be the same services for which he or she was previously paid and/or expects to be hired and paid for in the future Services are performed for a non-profit charity and the work is “charitable” in nature Services are performed for a state or local government agency and there is a “civic” purpose to the work Volunteering at Northeastern If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff/faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern, please review this guidance from Northeastern University Office of General Counsel. Due to the complexity of U.S. labor laws: all university departments, who want to have students volunteer within their department, are advised to thoroughly review this resource. If they have further questions on whether or not the engagement is considered volunteering, they should check directly with the Office of General Counsel. Related Articles: F-1 Curricular Practical Training J-1 Academic Training Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × Is it employment or volunteering? A common misconception is that the only difference is employees get paid and volunteers do not. However, according to U.S. labor laws, there is more to distinguish between employees and volunteers than whether an individual receives a regular paycheck or not. Work that is unpaid may still be considered employment that requires F-1 or J-1 off-campus work authorization. Who is considered an employee? The definition of an employee used in the context of immigration regulations is as follows: “An individual who provides services or labor for an employer for wages or other remuneration.” The term “remuneration” is very broad and includes a variety of non-monetary benefits, such as free housing, food, gifts, etc. Who is considered a volunteer? According to the Department of Labor, volunteers are individuals “who volunteer or donate their services, usually on a part-time basis, for public services, religious or humanitarian objectives, not as employees and without contemplation of pay, are not considered employees of the religious, charitable or similar non-profit organizations that receive their service.” To learn more, click here .Students Studying in \n",

However, not all students are required or choose to study during the summer term. Whether you plan to study or travel, it is important to maintain your status in the summer. You can learn more below. Summer Enrollment at Northeastern During required academic terms, F-1 and J-1 students must maintain full-time enrollment and appropriate on-ground presence. While the summer term is considered a vacation term for most continuing students, some students are required to maintain full-time enrollment in the summer. Please read the following information carefully to make sure you understand your summer enrollment requirements. What summer terms are available at Northeastern? CPS Undergraduate students and School of Law Students Full Summer CPS Graduate Students Summer Quarter All other Undergraduate and Graduate students Full Summer Summer 1* Summer 2* *Degree-seeking students that are eligible to enroll in summer 1 only or summer 2 only may enroll in half of their typical full-time enrollment requirement (6 credits for undergraduate students and 4 credits for graduate students). When do students have to maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence during the summer?

Related Articles: Guidelines on Maintaining Status Final Term Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × If I maintain full-time enrollment with on-ground presence during the summer term(s) can this term be considered as accrued time toward eligibility for F-1/J-1 benefits for work authorization? Some benefits require you to have been enrolled full-time in F-1 or J-1 status for a certain number of semesters/quarters in order to be eligible. You may count the summer term towards this requirement if you are enrolled full-time in the full summer or in the summer quarter; part-time summer enrollment and enrollment in summer 1 or summer 2 only cannot be counted towards eligibility for these benefits. If the summer is not required for me, can I still enroll in classes? Yes! You may enroll in both in-person and online courses at your leisure. However, if you plan to engage in any practical training opportunities, you must receive employment authorization.Students Studying in \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe United States F-1 Curricular Practical Training (CPT) Curricular Practical Training (CPT) is a benefit for eligible F-1 students to authorize approved experiential learning that takes place in the U.S. or with a U.S. based employer. Understanding Curricular Practical Training (CPT) CPT is a form of curricular training authorization available for eligible F-1 students during their program of study for experiential learning opportunities that are necessary and integral, or required, as part of an academic program at Northeastern University. CPT authorization must be obtained for every co-op, internship, practicum, clinical rotation, corporate residency, experiential PhD, or other approved experiential learning opportunity CPT authorization is required prior to the intended start date of the experiential learning , whether or not the activity takes place on-campus or off-campus CPT can be either full-time (more than 20 hours per week) or part-time (20 hours or less per week) CPT can be either paid or unpaid CPT is employer, location, full-time/part-time, and date specific. The employer’s name, address and the precise start and end dates must be authorized by OGS in advance Students must maintain on-ground presence during every required term of study. This includes any required term when a student is authorized for CPT Once authorized for CPT, F-1 students must comply with the authorization granted. Any extensions, cancellations, or changes to authorized CPT must be first approved by the academic advisor/co-op coordinator and OGS. Non-curricular based on-campus activities (commonly referred to as “on-campus employment”) do not require CPT authorization. If you have any questions about how this applies to you, please contact OGS. If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff/faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern, please review this guidance from Northeastern’s University Office of General Counsel. Eligibility Requirements In order to be eligible for CPT, students must meet all of the following requirements Comply with all college academic and enrollment eligibility requirements and policies for experiential learning This includes every co-op, internship, practicum, clinical rotation, corporate residency, experiential PhD, or other experiential learning opportunity, whether the activity takes place on-campus or off-campus Enroll in a course that requires an experiential learning component in the syllabus. This will usually be a Co-op course or another program-required course Enrollment must be maintained for the entire period of authorized CPT Complete at least one academic year as a full-time, degree-seeking student with an active SEVIS record* One academic year is defined as two semesters or three quarters while maintaining on-ground presence Time spent in Prematriculation and Pathway programs (including N.U.in, Foundation Year, NU Immerse, Global Scholars, and Global Pathways) will not accrue time toward CPT eligibility. Students enrolled in such programs will only begin to accrue time toward CPT eligibility once they have fully matriculated into a degree-seeking program *Limited exceptions to the completion of one academic year may apply in the following circumstances: For students in graduate-level programs that require immediate participation in experiential learning for program completion For students who completed one academic year in another visa status or institution changed to F-1 status within the U.S. or by travel and re-entry, who otherwise qualify Change of Status and SEVIS Transfer Students please review “Change of Status and Transfer Students” below for more information Maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence during every required term of study Review the OGS Guidelines on Maintaining Status for more information A huge part of your responsibility of maintaining your F-1 status is by actively participating in your academic activities in person. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term. As an international student, this prolonged absence may impact your F-1 status and your long-term academic goals as well as future immigration benefits. Make normal progress towards degree completion CPT authorization must not cause a delay in the completion of a student’s academic program Maintaining On-Ground Presence when Authorized for CPT F-1 international students must maintain on-ground presence during every required academic term of study to maintain nonimmigrant student status . This includes any required term when a student is engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization. Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during non-required terms. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In person (Traditional): All engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Hybrid: The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Remote (Online): The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer’s physical location Full-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization To maintain on-ground presence during a required term while pursuing full-time experiential learning, students have the following options: Option 1 : Engaging on-site (in person) at the employer’s physical location. This can be in-person or hybrid, as defined above Students will be maintaining on-ground presence based on their engagement with the employer Option 2 : Engaging remotely with the employer with simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course Students should enroll in an on-ground course stipulated by their academic program, which must run for the duration of the required academic term. Students should work with their academic department/advisor/co-op advisor to identify a course that is appropriate. Co-op students only : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements. If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor. Part-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization F-1 Students engaged remotely in part-time practical training/experiential learning must couple their part-time practical experience course enrollment with only on-ground courses to meet both the on-ground requirement and the full-time status requirement. As such, students engaging in part-time co-ops are not eligible to maintain their on-ground presence through the EXED course and may not enroll in online classes to meet the minimum credit requirements for the term. Experiential Learning with an Overseas Employer with CPT Authorization F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain their on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above. Failure to Maintain On-Ground Presence If an F-1 student withdraws from or fails to attend their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training, it will be considered a violation of status and the student’s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated. Regardless of the modality of the practical experience, students need regular engagement with both the practical training provider as well as the academic program to confirm successful progression of the practical training experience. Travel during Experiential Learning Engaging on-site at your employer’s physical location or participating in a university designated on-ground course is a mandatory to maintain the on-ground presence required by your F-1 student status. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term, as their F-1 status and academic goals may be negatively impacted. In cases where travel outside of the U.S. cannot be avoided, we highly recommend that students limit their absence from the U.S. and in-person classes as much as possible. If students choose to travel during a required term, they are taking on the associated risks, including but not limited to scrutiny by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) upon re-entry to the U.S. as well as scrutiny when applying for future immigration status or benefits. Application Process To participate in an experiential learning opportunity in the U.S., F-1 students must obtain CPT authorization from OGS. All CPT requests must first be academically reviewed, approved, and determined to be integral or required for degree completion, by the appropriate advisor, co-op coordinator, or authorized secondary approver. Step 1: Student completes the CPT Authorization Request e-form The student must fill out the CPT Authorization Request e-form. The documents the student will need include: Electronic I-94 (“Class of Admission” must be F-1 and “Admit Until Date” must indicate “D/S”) Passport identity page that is valid at least until the start date of the CPT authorization When the student has submitted the e-form it will be routed to the secondary approver as indicated in the e-form. Step 2: Secondary approver reviews student's CPT e-form submission The Authorized Secondary Approver (CPT) who receives the request will review the information the student has entered and determine if they approve it academically as either integral or required for program completion. If approved, the Authorized Secondary Approver will submit the request to OGS. If the Authorized Secondary Approver does not approve of the request, they will email the student directly regarding their decision. See below for Authorized Secondary Approver Lists : Undergraduate Students Graduate Students Step 3: OGS reviews completed CPT e-form submission Upon receipt of the completed e-form from the Secondary Approver, OGS will review the CPT request within 15 business days. OGS will examine the student’s documents to determine if they meet all F-1 eligibility requirements for CPT. OGS may place the request on hold and email the student/advisor for more information or approve/deny the CPT request. Step 4: Student receives updated I-20 with CPT recommendation If your CPT request is approved, a Designated School Official (DSO) from OGS will send the I-20 electronically to your Northeastern University email. You are advised to: Review your I-20 to ensure all information is accurate and complete Print and sign your I-20 Only work within the listed start and end dates on your I-20 Updating or changing your CPT authorization While on CPT, any updates, extensions, changes, or cancellations to your employment must be reported to and approved both by your academic/co-op advisor and by a DSO in OGS. These changes include: Employer Location Date Number of hours worked per week (full-time/part-time) Cancellations Other corrections Once authorized for CPT, F-1 students must comply with the authorization granted. How CPT affects OPT Eligibility If an F-1 student exceeds 364 days of full-time CPT (more than 20 hours per week at a degree level—bachelor’s, master’s or doctorate), they will lose their eligibility to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) at that degree level. Part-time CPT (20 hours per week or less) does not accrue time towards the 364-day calculation. When counting CPT days, every day between the start and end date of CPT is included (including the start and end dates). The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization, not the days the student actually worked. This means even if it was a weekend, holiday, vacation etc., it still counts if the student had CPT authorization. It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full-time CPT days have been used per degree level. Students can use previously issued I-20s to document this. Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this e-form . As a reminder, CPT is a benefit of F-1 status, not a guarantee. While students may be able to work up to 364 days while maintaining OPT eligibility, CPT authorization is directly tied to a student’s academic curriculum. Therefore, the amount of CPT for which students are eligible and may be authorized is entirely based on their program of study, as well as F-1 federal regulations. Simply because an F-1 student has not engaged in 364 days of full-time CPT does not necessarily mean the student is eligible for additional CPT or an extension of a current CPT authorization. Change of Status and SEVIS Transfer Students Change of Status Students Full-time students who have applied to change their immigration status to F-1 within the U.S. (application through USICS) or by traveling (via consular processing) may be eligible to use time from a previous immigration status towards accruing benefits, such as CPT, as long as the student has previously maintained full-time enrollment requirements. Please contact OGS to make an appointment with a DSO to discuss CPT eligibility and bring all applicable documentation with you (e.g. official transcripts, a copy of your I-797 approval notice if you changed status within the U.S.). SEVIS Transfer Students International students with Active F-1 records who transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University may be eligible to use enrolled time at the previous institution towards the one academic year requirement for CPT eligibility. Please contact OGS to make an appointment with a DSO to discuss CPT eligibility and have all applicable documentation available (e.g. official transcripts and your previous I-20) Key Resources CPT Authorization Request Form » This e-form is to request authorization for Curricular Practical Training.

Related Articles: Social Security Number Unauthorized Employment Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × Can I request CPT authorization in my final term of study? The Office of Global Services will only authorize CPT in a student’s final term if the practical training experience is required for degree completion. Can I request CPT authorization for my independent study course? Independent study courses do not qualify for CPT authorization. Do I need CPT authorization for an internship or co-op that is unpaid? Yes! All work associated with an experiential learning opportunity requires CPT authorization, even if it is unpaid. Is there a limit to the number of hours per week I can work while authorized for CPT? In order to know the answer to this, you will need to understand what kind of CPT authorization you have. You can find this information on the second page of your I-20. If your I-20 states you have part-time CPT, then this means you can never exceed 20 hours per week. If your I-20 states you have full-time CPT, then this means there is no limit to the number of hours per week you can work. However, you must always check with your advisor or co-op coordinator to see if they have a limit to the number of hours per week you can work. Do I need CPT authorization for training dates that occur prior to employment? Yes, all training dates require prior CPT authorization. Remember, even time spend while you are not being paid requires CPT authorization. How will I know if I have received CPT authorization? You will know if you have CPT authorization by checking the second page of your most recent I-20. On the second page of your I-20, you will see all the details of your employment authorization. Can I take additional courses while I'm participating in a co-op/internship/clinical rotation? If you would like to enroll in courses while you are participating in a co-op/internship/clinical rotation, you must check with your co-op department or advisor to see if there are academic or university restrictions that would prevent you from doing so. Can I have an on-campus job while I am authorized for CPT during a co-op/internship/clinical rotation? Yes, students are allowed to work on-campus while they also have CPT. However, students are not allowed to work on an SGA (Stipended Graduate Assistantship) and be authorized for CPT for a paid experience at the same time. Please keep in mind that some colleges may not allow you to work on-campus and be on coop at the same time or may have restrictions on how much on-campus employment is allowed while on coop. If this is the case, you will need to follow your co-op department’s rules. My employer offered to extend my co-op/internship on a part-time basis. Can I do this? If your employer offers to extend your co-op/internship on a part-time basis, you must inquire with your academic department to determine if the extension is curricular and is integral to your course of study. If it is determined that the continuation of your co-op/internship is integral to your course of study, you may be eligible to request CPT authorization again. If the continuation of the co-op/internship is not supported academically, you may be eligible to apply for Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training (Pre-OPT). Does part-time CPT count towards the 364 day mark that affects my OPT eligibility? No, part-time CPT authorization does not count towards the 364 days of authorization that would impact OPT eligibility. How can I find out how much CPT time I've used? You can calculate how much CPT time you’ve used by looking at past I-20s. You can also request documentation of your previous CPT authorizations from OGS by filling out the following e-form. Do I need CPT authorization if Northeastern is my employer during co-op/internship/clinical rotation? Students must be authorized for CPT for any experiential learning they conduct, on- or off-campus, paid or unpaid. Students who pursue experiential learning with Northeastern as their employer require CPT authorization. Can I end my CPT earlier than the original end date? Students must consult with their co-op and/or academic advisor if there will be any changes to their approved Co-op/CPT employment in order to ensure that all academic requirements will be met (this link is specific to Co-op requirements). Then, students must follow up with OGS by completing the CPT Update E-form to report changes to OGS in order to receive an updated I-20. How do I find who my authorized secondary approver for CPT is? Authorized secondary approvers are often co-op coordinators or academic advisors for programs that involve experiential learning other than co-op. The lists of authorized secondary approvers for CPT can be found here: Undergraduate students Graduate students I am pursuing a double/combined major. How do I know if my opportunity is eligible for CPT? Students are only eligible for CPT authorization if their opportunity is directly related to their major area of study. For students with double or combined majors, the opportunity may be related to either major.

Complexities of volunteering If you are interested in volunteering, you must be aware of relevant F-1 and J-1 regulations, so you and the organization do not violate any rules regarding employment authorization. F-1 and J-1 students who are working off-campus must be authorized before engaging in the employment. Without proper authorization, off-campus employment, including some volunteering, would be considered a violation of your F-1 or J-1 requirements. The consequences may include loss of your F-1 or J-1 status in the U.S.—making it difficult to reacquire lawful status within the U.S. If you are considering engaging in a volunteering opportunity, please make an appointment with an OGS adviser before making plans to begin any activity. Volunteering vs. Unpaid Internship There is a difference between volunteering and engaging in an unpaid internship. Volunteering refers to donating time with an organization whose primary purpose is charitable or humanitarian in nature, without remuneration or any other type of compensation. F-1 and J-1 students are allowed to engage in volunteer work as long as it meets this stated criteria. For example, it is permitted for F-1 and J-1 students to volunteer at a local homeless shelter, charitable food pantry, or American Red Cross. Unpaid internships, on the other hand, do not usually qualify as “volunteer” activity. Internships, both paid and unpaid, are primarily offered by the private sector and related to the intern’s major field of study. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students are advised to seek work authorization prior in order to engage in unpaid internships. The Department of Labor in the U.S. has guidelines for those seeking an unpaid internship, please see here , the “Primary Beneficiary Test” outlined on the Department of Labor’s website can be used to determine whether or not the unpaid internship is considered employment. Because of the consequences of unauthorized employment, we caution all F-1 and J-1 students to consult the Office of Global Services when considering engaging in an unpaid internship or volunteering opportunity. Please make an appointment with an OGS advisor before making plans to begin any activity. U.S. Department of Labor's definition volunteering The Department of Labor is concerned both with the protection of jobs for U.S citizens, and with the prevention of exploitation of workers. They have created laws to ensure employment that should be paid is not done for free. While both you and the employer may be happy with an unpaid arrangement (for example, you may be eager to work even on an unpaid basis in a company in order to gain job experience), this may be considered an unfair arrangement in cases where the work is normally performed by a paid person and both the company and the employee are benefiting from the employment. How to determine whether an activity is truly volunteering and does NOT require work authorization Employment authorization is NOT required when the work performed can be considered volunteering. To be considered volunteering, the work performed by the individual must meet the following criteria: No compensation or expectation of compensation The volunteer cannot displace a genuine employee and the services provided by the volunteer should not be the same services for which he or she was previously paid and/or expects to be hired and paid for in the future Services are performed for a non-profit charity and the work is “charitable” in nature Services are performed for a state or local government agency and there is a “civic” purpose to the work Volunteering at Northeastern If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff/faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern, please review this guidance from Northeastern University Office of General Counsel. Due to the complexity of U.S. labor laws: all university departments, who want to have students volunteer within their department, are advised to thoroughly review this resource. If they have further questions on whether or not the engagement is considered volunteering, they should check directly with the Office of General Counsel. Related Articles: F-1 Curricular Practical Training J-1 Academic Training Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × Is it employment or volunteering? A common misconception is that the only difference is employees get paid and volunteers do not. However, according to U.S. labor laws, there is more to distinguish between employees and volunteers than whether an individual receives a regular paycheck or not. Work that is unpaid may still be considered employment that requires F-1 or J-1 off-campus work authorization. Who is considered an employee? The definition of an employee used in the context of immigration regulations is as follows: “An individual who provides services or labor for an employer for wages or other remuneration.” The term “remuneration” is very broad and includes a variety of non-monetary benefits, such as free housing, food, gifts, etc. Who is considered a volunteer? According to the Department of Labor, volunteers are individuals “who volunteer or donate their services, usually on a part-time basis, for public services, religious or humanitarian objectives, not as employees and without contemplation of pay, are not considered employees of the religious, charitable or similar non-profit organizations that receive their service.” To learn more, click here .Students Studying in \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCanada Working While Studying Updated November 15th, 2024 Learn more about studying in Canada Work on Campus You can work on-campus as an international student without a Work Permit if you meet the three criteria below: You have a valid study permit with a condition allowing you to work ; You are a full-time student at Northeastern University; You have a Social Insurance Number (SIN) You must stop working on-campus: on the day you stop studying full-time when your study permit expires if you’re on an authorized leave from your studies if you’re switching schools and aren’t currently studying You can return to work only once you’re back to studying and you meet all the requirements to work on-campus.

Related Articles: Guidelines on Maintaining Status Final Term Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × If I maintain full-time enrollment with on-ground presence during the summer term(s) can this term be considered as accrued time toward eligibility for F-1/J-1 benefits for work authorization? Some benefits require you to have been enrolled full-time in F-1 or J-1 status for a certain number of semesters/quarters in order to be eligible. You may count the summer term towards this requirement if you are enrolled full-time in the full summer or in the summer quarter; part-time summer enrollment and enrollment in summer 1 or summer 2 only cannot be counted towards eligibility for these benefits. If the summer is not required for me, can I still enroll in classes? Yes! You may enroll in both in-person and online courses at your leisure. However, if you plan to engage in any practical training opportunities, you must receive employment authorization.Students Studying in \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe United States F-1 Curricular Practical Training (CPT) Curricular Practical Training (CPT) is a benefit for eligible F-1 students to authorize approved experiential learning that takes place in the U.S. or with a U.S. based employer. Understanding Curricular Practical Training (CPT) CPT is a form of curricular training authorization available for eligible F-1 students during their program of study for experiential learning opportunities that are necessary and integral, or required, as part of an academic program at Northeastern University. CPT authorization must be obtained for every co-op, internship, practicum, clinical rotation, corporate residency, experiential PhD, or other approved experiential learning opportunity CPT authorization is required prior to the intended start date of the experiential learning , whether or not the activity takes place on-campus or off-campus CPT can be either full-time (more than 20 hours per week) or part-time (20 hours or less per week) CPT can be either paid or unpaid CPT is employer, location, full-time/part-time, and date specific. The employer’s name, address and the precise start and end dates must be authorized by OGS in advance Students must maintain on-ground presence during every required term of study. This includes any required term when a student is authorized for CPT Once authorized for CPT, F-1 students must comply with the authorization granted. Any extensions, cancellations, or changes to authorized CPT must be first approved by the academic advisor/co-op coordinator and OGS. Non-curricular based on-campus activities (commonly referred to as “on-campus employment”) do not require CPT authorization. If you have any questions about how this applies to you, please contact OGS. If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff/faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern, please review this guidance from Northeastern’s University Office of General Counsel. Eligibility Requirements In order to be eligible for CPT, students must meet all of the following requirements Comply with all college academic and enrollment eligibility requirements and policies for experiential learning This includes every co-op, internship, practicum, clinical rotation, corporate residency, experiential PhD, or other experiential learning opportunity, whether the activity takes place on-campus or off-campus Enroll in a course that requires an experiential learning component in the syllabus. This will usually be a Co-op course or another program-required course Enrollment must be maintained for the entire period of authorized CPT Complete at least one academic year as a full-time, degree-seeking student with an active SEVIS record* One academic year is defined as two semesters or three quarters while maintaining on-ground presence Time spent in Prematriculation and Pathway programs (including N.U.in, Foundation Year, NU Immerse, Global Scholars, and Global Pathways) will not accrue time toward CPT eligibility. Students enrolled in such programs will only begin to accrue time toward CPT eligibility once they have fully matriculated into a degree-seeking program *Limited exceptions to the completion of one academic year may apply in the following circumstances: For students in graduate-level programs that require immediate participation in experiential learning for program completion For students who completed one academic year in another visa status or institution changed to F-1 status within the U.S. or by travel and re-entry, who otherwise qualify Change of Status and SEVIS Transfer Students please review “Change of Status and Transfer Students” below for more information Maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence during every required term of study Review the OGS Guidelines on Maintaining Status for more information A huge part of your responsibility of maintaining your F-1 status is by actively participating in your academic activities in person. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term. As an international student, this prolonged absence may impact your F-1 status and your long-term academic goals as well as future immigration benefits. Make normal progress towards degree completion CPT authorization must not cause a delay in the completion of a student’s academic program Maintaining On-Ground Presence when Authorized for CPT F-1 international students must maintain on-ground presence during every required academic term of study to maintain nonimmigrant student status . This includes any required term when a student is engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization. Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during non-required terms. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In person (Traditional): All engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Hybrid: The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Remote (Online): The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer’s physical location Full-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization To maintain on-ground presence during a required term while pursuing full-time experiential learning, students have the following options: Option 1 : Engaging on-site (in person) at the employer’s physical location. This can be in-person or hybrid, as defined above Students will be maintaining on-ground presence based on their engagement with the employer Option 2 : Engaging remotely with the employer with simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course Students should enroll in an on-ground course stipulated by their academic program, which must run for the duration of the required academic term. Students should work with their academic department/advisor/co-op advisor to identify a course that is appropriate. Co-op students only : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements. If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor. Part-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization F-1 Students engaged remotely in part-time practical training/experiential learning must couple their part-time practical experience course enrollment with only on-ground courses to meet both the on-ground requirement and the full-time status requirement. As such, students engaging in part-time co-ops are not eligible to maintain their on-ground presence through the EXED course and may not enroll in online classes to meet the minimum credit requirements for the term. Experiential Learning with an Overseas Employer with CPT Authorization F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain their on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above. Failure to Maintain On-Ground Presence If an F-1 student withdraws from or fails to attend their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training, it will be considered a violation of status and the student’s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated. Regardless of the modality of the practical experience, students need regular engagement with both the practical training provider as well as the academic program to confirm successful progression of the practical training experience. Travel during Experiential Learning Engaging on-site at your employer’s physical location or participating in a university designated on-ground course is a mandatory to maintain the on-ground presence required by your F-1 student status. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term, as their F-1 status and academic goals may be negatively impacted. In cases where travel outside of the U.S. cannot be avoided, we highly recommend that students limit their absence from the U.S. and in-person classes as much as possible. If students choose to travel during a required term, they are taking on the associated risks, including but not limited to scrutiny by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) upon re-entry to the U.S. as well as scrutiny when applying for future immigration status or benefits. Application Process To participate in an experiential learning opportunity in the U.S., F-1 students must obtain CPT authorization from OGS. All CPT requests must first be academically reviewed, approved, and determined to be integral or required for degree completion, by the appropriate advisor, co-op coordinator, or authorized secondary approver. Step 1: Student completes the CPT Authorization Request e-form The student must fill out the CPT Authorization Request e-form. The documents the student will need include: Electronic I-94 (“Class of Admission” must be F-1 and “Admit Until Date” must indicate “D/S”) Passport identity page that is valid at least until the start date of the CPT authorization When the student has submitted the e-form it will be routed to the secondary approver as indicated in the e-form. Step 2: Secondary approver reviews student's CPT e-form submission The Authorized Secondary Approver (CPT) who receives the request will review the information the student has entered and determine if they approve it academically as either integral or required for program completion. If approved, the Authorized Secondary Approver will submit the request to OGS. If the Authorized Secondary Approver does not approve of the request, they will email the student directly regarding their decision. See below for Authorized Secondary Approver Lists : Undergraduate Students Graduate Students Step 3: OGS reviews completed CPT e-form submission Upon receipt of the completed e-form from the Secondary Approver, OGS will review the CPT request within 15 business days. OGS will examine the student’s documents to determine if they meet all F-1 eligibility requirements for CPT. OGS may place the request on hold and email the student/advisor for more information or approve/deny the CPT request. Step 4: Student receives updated I-20 with CPT recommendation If your CPT request is approved, a Designated School Official (DSO) from OGS will send the I-20 electronically to your Northeastern University email. You are advised to: Review your I-20 to ensure all information is accurate and complete Print and sign your I-20 Only work within the listed start and end dates on your I-20 Updating or changing your CPT authorization While on CPT, any updates, extensions, changes, or cancellations to your employment must be reported to and approved both by your academic/co-op advisor and by a DSO in OGS. These changes include: Employer Location Date Number of hours worked per week (full-time/part-time) Cancellations Other corrections Once authorized for CPT, F-1 students must comply with the authorization granted. How CPT affects OPT Eligibility If an F-1 student exceeds 364 days of full-time CPT (more than 20 hours per week at a degree level—bachelor’s, master’s or doctorate), they will lose their eligibility to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) at that degree level. Part-time CPT (20 hours per week or less) does not accrue time towards the 364-day calculation. When counting CPT days, every day between the start and end date of CPT is included (including the start and end dates). The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization, not the days the student actually worked. This means even if it was a weekend, holiday, vacation etc., it still counts if the student had CPT authorization. It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full-time CPT days have been used per degree level. Students can use previously issued I-20s to document this. Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this e-form . As a reminder, CPT is a benefit of F-1 status, not a guarantee. While students may be able to work up to 364 days while maintaining OPT eligibility, CPT authorization is directly tied to a student’s academic curriculum. Therefore, the amount of CPT for which students are eligible and may be authorized is entirely based on their program of study, as well as F-1 federal regulations. Simply because an F-1 student has not engaged in 364 days of full-time CPT does not necessarily mean the student is eligible for additional CPT or an extension of a current CPT authorization. Change of Status and SEVIS Transfer Students Change of Status Students Full-time students who have applied to change their immigration status to F-1 within the U.S. (application through USICS) or by traveling (via consular processing) may be eligible to use time from a previous immigration status towards accruing benefits, such as CPT, as long as the student has previously maintained full-time enrollment requirements. Please contact OGS to make an appointment with a DSO to discuss CPT eligibility and bring all applicable documentation with you (e.g. official transcripts, a copy of your I-797 approval notice if you changed status within the U.S.). SEVIS Transfer Students International students with Active F-1 records who transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University may be eligible to use enrolled time at the previous institution towards the one academic year requirement for CPT eligibility. Please contact OGS to make an appointment with a DSO to discuss CPT eligibility and have all applicable documentation available (e.g. official transcripts and your previous I-20) Key Resources CPT Authorization Request Form » This e-form is to request authorization for Curricular Practical Training.

Related Articles: Social Security Number Unauthorized Employment Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × Can I request CPT authorization in my final term of study? The Office of Global Services will only authorize CPT in a student’s final term if the practical training experience is required for degree completion. Can I request CPT authorization for my independent study course? Independent study courses do not qualify for CPT authorization. Do I need CPT authorization for an internship or co-op that is unpaid? Yes! All work associated with an experiential learning opportunity requires CPT authorization, even if it is unpaid. Is there a limit to the number of hours per week I can work while authorized for CPT? In order to know the answer to this, you will need to understand what kind of CPT authorization you have. You can find this information on the second page of your I-20. If your I-20 states you have part-time CPT, then this means you can never exceed 20 hours per week. If your I-20 states you have full-time CPT, then this means there is no limit to the number of hours per week you can work. However, you must always check with your advisor or co-op coordinator to see if they have a limit to the number of hours per week you can work. Do I need CPT authorization for training dates that occur prior to employment? Yes, all training dates require prior CPT authorization. Remember, even time spend while you are not being paid requires CPT authorization. How will I know if I have received CPT authorization? You will know if you have CPT authorization by checking the second page of your most recent I-20. On the second page of your I-20, you will see all the details of your employment authorization. Can I take additional courses while I'm participating in a co-op/internship/clinical rotation? If you would like to enroll in courses while you are participating in a co-op/internship/clinical rotation, you must check with your co-op department or advisor to see if there are academic or university restrictions that would prevent you from doing so. Can I have an on-campus job while I am authorized for CPT during a co-op/internship/clinical rotation? Yes, students are allowed to work on-campus while they also have CPT. However, students are not allowed to work on an SGA (Stipended Graduate Assistantship) and be authorized for CPT for a paid experience at the same time. Please keep in mind that some colleges may not allow you to work on-campus and be on coop at the same time or may have restrictions on how much on-campus employment is allowed while on coop. If this is the case, you will need to follow your co-op department’s rules. My employer offered to extend my co-op/internship on a part-time basis. Can I do this? If your employer offers to extend your co-op/internship on a part-time basis, you must inquire with your academic department to determine if the extension is curricular and is integral to your course of study. If it is determined that the continuation of your co-op/internship is integral to your course of study, you may be eligible to request CPT authorization again. If the continuation of the co-op/internship is not supported academically, you may be eligible to apply for Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training (Pre-OPT). Does part-time CPT count towards the 364 day mark that affects my OPT eligibility? No, part-time CPT authorization does not count towards the 364 days of authorization that would impact OPT eligibility. How can I find out how much CPT time I've used? You can calculate how much CPT time you’ve used by looking at past I-20s. You can also request documentation of your previous CPT authorizations from OGS by filling out the following e-form. Do I need CPT authorization if Northeastern is my employer during co-op/internship/clinical rotation? Students must be authorized for CPT for any experiential learning they conduct, on- or off-campus, paid or unpaid. Students who pursue experiential learning with Northeastern as their employer require CPT authorization. Can I end my CPT earlier than the original end date? Students must consult with their co-op and/or academic advisor if there will be any changes to their approved Co-op/CPT employment in order to ensure that all academic requirements will be met (this link is specific to Co-op requirements). Then, students must follow up with OGS by completing the CPT Update E-form to report changes to OGS in order to receive an updated I-20. How do I find who my authorized secondary approver for CPT is? Authorized secondary approvers are often co-op coordinators or academic advisors for programs that involve experiential learning other than co-op. The lists of authorized secondary approvers for CPT can be found here: Undergraduate students Graduate students I am pursuing a double/combined major. How do I know if my opportunity is eligible for CPT? Students are only eligible for CPT authorization if their opportunity is directly related to their major area of study. For students with double or combined majors, the opportunity may be related to either major. This criteria is confirmed by the students authorized secondary approver, as they have the required understanding about student’s major/curriculum to make this determination.Students Studying in \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe United States Volunteering and Unpaid Internships Northeastern University values experiential learning and serving our communities.  While volunteering may seem simple, it is actually a complex area in which immigration regulations and labor laws intersect. Complexities of volunteering If you are interested in volunteering, you must be aware of relevant F-1 and J-1 regulations, so you and the organization do not violate any rules regarding employment authorization. F-1 and J-1 students who are working off-campus must be authorized before engaging in the employment. Without proper authorization, off-campus employment, including some volunteering, would be considered a violation of your F-1 or J-1 requirements. The consequences may include loss of your F-1 or J-1 status in the U.S.—making it difficult to reacquire lawful status within the U.S. If you are considering engaging in a volunteering opportunity, please make an appointment with an OGS adviser before making plans to begin any activity. Volunteering vs. Unpaid Internship There is a difference between volunteering and engaging in an unpaid internship. Volunteering refers to donating time with an organization whose primary purpose is charitable or humanitarian in nature, without remuneration or any other type of compensation. F-1 and J-1 students are allowed to engage in volunteer work as long as it meets this stated criteria. For example, it is permitted for F-1 and J-1 students to volunteer at a local homeless shelter, charitable food pantry, or American Red Cross. Unpaid internships, on the other hand, do not usually qualify as “volunteer” activity. Internships, both paid and unpaid, are primarily offered by the private sector and related to the intern’s major field of study. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students are advised to seek work authorization prior in order to engage in unpaid internships. The Department of Labor in the U.S. has guidelines for those seeking an unpaid internship, please see here , the “Primary Beneficiary Test” outlined on the Department of Labor’s website can be used to determine whether or not the unpaid internship is considered employment. Because of the consequences of unauthorized employment, we caution all F-1 and J-1 students to consult the Office of Global Services when considering engaging in an unpaid internship or volunteering opportunity. Please make an appointment with an OGS advisor before making plans to begin any activity. U.S. Department of Labor's definition volunteering The Department of Labor is concerned both with the protection of jobs for U.S citizens, and with the prevention of exploitation of workers. They have created laws to ensure employment that should be paid is not done for free. While both you and the employer may be happy with an unpaid arrangement (for example, you may be eager to work even on an unpaid basis in a company in order to gain job experience), this may be considered an unfair arrangement in cases where the work is normally performed by a paid person and both the company and the employee are benefiting from the employment. How to determine whether an activity is truly volunteering and does NOT require work authorization Employment authorization is NOT required when the work performed can be considered volunteering. To be considered volunteering, the work performed by the individual must meet the following criteria: No compensation or expectation of compensation The volunteer cannot displace a genuine employee and the services provided by the volunteer should not be the same services for which he or she was previously paid and/or expects to be hired and paid for in the future Services are performed for a non-profit charity and the work is “charitable” in nature Services are performed for a state or local government agency and there is a “civic” purpose to the work Volunteering at Northeastern If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff/faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern, please review this guidance from Northeastern University Office of General Counsel. Due to the complexity of U.S. labor laws: all university departments, who want to have students volunteer within their department, are advised to thoroughly review this resource. If they have further questions on whether or not the engagement is considered volunteering, they should check directly with the Office of General Counsel.

A common misconception is that the only difference is employees get paid and volunteers do not. However, according to U.S. labor laws, there is more to distinguish between employees and volunteers than whether an individual receives a regular paycheck or not. Work that is unpaid may still be considered employment that requires F-1 or J-1 off-campus work authorization. Who is considered an employee? The definition of an employee used in the context of immigration regulations is as follows: “An individual who provides services or labor for an employer for wages or other remuneration.” The term “remuneration” is very broad and includes a variety of non-monetary benefits, such as free housing, food, gifts, etc. Who is considered a volunteer? According to the Department of Labor, volunteers are individuals “who volunteer or donate their services, usually on a part-time basis, for public services, religious or humanitarian objectives, not as employees and without contemplation of pay, are not considered employees of the religious, charitable or similar non-profit organizations that receive their service.” To learn more, click here .Students Studying in \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCanada Working While Studying Updated November 15th, 2024 Learn more about studying in Canada Work on Campus You can work on-campus as an international student without a Work Permit if you meet the three criteria below: You have a valid study permit with a condition allowing you to work ; You are a full-time student at Northeastern University; You have a Social Insurance Number (SIN) You must stop working on-campus: on the day you stop studying full-time when your study permit expires if you’re on an authorized leave from your studies if you’re switching schools and aren’t currently studying You can return to work only once you’re back to studying and you meet all the requirements to work on-campus.
