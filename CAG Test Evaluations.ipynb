The application cannot be submitted until the J-2 dependent has entered the U.S. in J-2 status, and can only be submitted while the J-2 dependent is physically present in the U.S. The EAD card will typically be issued to match the length of the J-1’s DS-2019.

This includes any required term when a student is engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization. Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during non-required terms. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In person (Traditional): All engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Hybrid: The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Remote (Online): The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer’s physical location Full-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization To maintain on-ground presence during a required term while pursuing full-time experiential learning, students have the following options: Option 1 : Engaging on-site (in person) at the employer’s physical location. This can be in-person or hybrid, as defined above Students will be maintaining on-ground presence based on their engagement with the employer Option 2 : Engaging remotely with the employer with simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course Students should enroll in an on-ground course stipulated by their academic program, which must run for the duration of the required academic term. Students should work with their academic department/advisor/co-op advisor to identify a course that is appropriate. Co-op students only : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements. If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor. Part-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization F-1 Students engaged remotely in part-time practical training/experiential learning must couple their part-time practical experience course enrollment with only on-ground courses to meet both the on-ground requirement and the full-time status requirement. As such, students engaging in part-time co-ops are not eligible to maintain their on-ground presence through the EXED course and may not enroll in online classes to meet the minimum credit requirements for the term. Experiential Learning with an Overseas Employer with CPT Authorization F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain their on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above. Failure to Maintain On-Ground Presence If an F-1 student withdraws from or fails to attend their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training, it will be considered a violation of status and the student’s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated. Regardless of the modality of the practical experience, students need regular engagement with both the practical training provider as well as the academic program to confirm successful progression of the practical training experience. Travel during Experiential Learning Engaging on-site at your employer’s physical location or participating in a university designated on-ground course is a mandatory to maintain the on-ground presence required by your F-1 student status. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term, as their F-1 status and academic goals may be negatively impacted. In cases where travel outside of the U.S. cannot be avoided, we highly recommend that students limit their absence from the U.S. and in-person classes as much as possible. If students choose to travel during a required term, they are taking on the associated risks, including but not limited to scrutiny by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) upon re-entry to the U.S. as well as scrutiny when applying for future immigration status or benefits.',\n",
