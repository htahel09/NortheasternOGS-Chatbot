The F-1 visa is an entry document, and must be valid on the date that you are entering the U.S.\r\n\r\nPlease carefully review the information below to better understand the F-1 visa application process and to prepare for your F-1 visa interview. Applying for an F-1 Visa For comprehensive information about the F-1 student visa application process, please visit the U.S. Department of State website. Students are encouraged to apply for their F-1 visa as soon as they receive their Northeastern Form I-20. U.S. Embassies or U.S. Consulates are able to issue F-1 entry visas up to 365 days before the program start date listed on your I-20. In most countries, student visa applicants must appear in person for the visa interview. However, each U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate sets its own interview policies and procedures. Students should consult the specific embassy website or call for application instructions. Visit the Website of U.S. Embassies, Consulates, and Diplomatic Missions U.S. Department of State estimated Global Visa Wait Times The following documents are typically required for the F-1 visa application: Online Non-immigrant Visa Application Form (DS-160) confirmation page See below if you do not yet have a local U.S. address For a contact person, you can put the name of the person who signed your I-20.

No assurances regarding the issuance of visas can be given in advance. Therefore, final travel plans or the purchase of non-refundable tickets should not be made until a visa has been issued. After the visa has been issued, please be sure the F-1 visa stamp in your passport is accurate and that your original I-20 has been returned to you as you will need to have it in hand when entering the U.S. Note: Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not need to apply for an F-1 visa but they are required to have the I-20 and pay the SEVIS I-901 fee before entering the U.S. to study.

Here are some of the common questions that you may expect. Most commonly asked F-1 visa interview questions What’s your purpose for going to the U.S.? Why did you choose to study in the U.S.? Which University will you attend? What will be your degree and major? Did you go to a University at your home country? What is your occupation at the moment? Why don’t you continue your studies in your home country? How many universities did you apply to and in which countries? How many universities sent you an admittance letter? Have you ever been to the U.S. before? Why did you choose a university in Boston? Where will you be staying while in the U.S.? What do you know about U.S. educational system?

What are your plans after you finish with your studies in the U.S.? Do you have relatives or friends in the U.S.? Do you have a career that you want to pursue after you finish with your studies? Tell me a little bit about your family. Do you have any siblings? 10 Points to Remember When Applying for a Student Visa Please use this guide from NAFSA for your reference: 10 Points to Remember When Applying for a Student Visa . Visa Application Outcomes Please note that if you do not receive your F-1 visa prior to the start of your program, you may be advised to defer your admission to a future term. Approval Congratulations! The majority of F-1 visa applicants are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you. Denials 214(b) Denial Although F-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their students and any qualifying periods of post-completion OPT or STEM OPT. The F-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer’s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when an F-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your F-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. PP 10043 Denial On May 29, 2020, a Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China’s “military-civil fusion strategy.” This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected. Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations. If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance. Students should review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials. Administrative Processing The outcome of some F-1 visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as “ Administrative Processing .” Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months. In these cases, the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. You should follow the instructions listed on the 221(g) notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance. What is “Administrative Processing”? After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including: Your country of birth or citizenship Academic or employment history, including military experience Travel history Source of funding Past U.S. immigration records Family members’ backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence Geopolitical factors These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn’t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields. Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa. Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process. If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment. Next Steps During Administrative Processing If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process. Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing. Expedited Visa Appointments U.S. Embassies/Consulates overseas may be able to expedite your F-1 visa interview date if your I-20 program start date is within 60 days, and there are no available visa interview slots prior to your start date. The process to request an expedited F-1 visa interview varies by location. You should refer to the instructions on the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will interview, or on their online appointment scheduling site. You will need to provide proof of the need for an earlier appointment (such as your I-20 showing a program start date within 60 days). Please note : You must first submit the online visa application form (DS-160), pay the application fee, and schedule the first available interview appointment. Only at this point will a consular section consider your request for an expedited appointment. Entering the U.S. When preparing for your arrival to the U.S., you should plan your travel according to the information provided by your college. According to immigration regulations, F-1 student visa holders can enter the U.S. up to 30 days prior to the program report date on the I-20. Students transferring to Northeastern University in F-1 status from another institution or changing their degree level at Northeastern may stay in the U.S. or travel between programs. And, they may enter the U.S. more than 30 days before the new program start date listed on your I-20. Documents to Bring When Entering the U.S. Valid passport with an official F-1 visa stamp Your original I-20 issued by Northeastern University I-901 SEVIS fee receipt Financial documents Admissions letter At the U.S. port of entry, you will be required to present your passport and I-20 to the immigration officer who will stamp your passport. In most cases, the officer notes “D/S” (Duration of Status) on your passport pages. This means you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the length of time indicated on your I-20, provided that you maintain full-time enrollment and a valid F-1 visa status. Ensure your passport is properly stamped before exiting the immigration inspection area. Do not enter the U.S. in visitor status (B-1/B-2, WT, or WB). This status does not permit full-time study in the U.S. After your arrival, print your Admission (I-94) number at cbp.gov/I94 and keep a copy of all travel documents (I-94 information, F-1 visa, and I-20) for your personal records. Ensure your I-94 print out contains the correct information, including F-1 visa status and “Duration of Status.” Related Articles: Paying the I-901 SEVIS Fee Obtaining I-94 Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × If I already have a visa from another university or college in the U.S. - do I need to get a new one for Northeastern? If you received a transfer pending I-20 from Northeastern with the same SEVIS identification as from your previous institution, as reflected on your F-1 visa page in passport, then you will not need to renew your F-1 visa for Northeastern. If your current visa from another institution already expired and/or you are planning to go abroad before starting at Northeastern or during your program, then you will need to renew your F-1 visa before reentering the U.S. Do I need to go to the U.S. Consulate before re-entering the U.S.? If your F-1 visa expired and you are not subject to automatic visa re-validation, then you will need to go to the U.S. Consulate in order to get your F-1 visa renewed. Is it possible for me to apply for a visa in a country different from my home country? Although, we recommend that you apply for an F-1 visa in your home country, you can apply for your visa in another foreign country. Please contact the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate where you intend to apply for more information on the process. Is there a limit to the number of dependents that I can bring to the U.S.? I-20 request e-form has a limit of up to four dependents. If you intend to bring more, please contact OGS. Can I bring family members as dependents that are not spouses or children? The only family members that can receive an F-2 visa are spouses and children under the age of 21. What is the I-901 Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee and how do I pay it? The I-901 SEVIS fee is one of the required fees that must be paid to allow students to be approved for an F-1 visa. Proof of payment will be asked at the visa interview. You can learn how to pay this fee and receive the I-901 confirmation receipt here . Where do I find the school code which is needed for the online visa application? The school code should be stated under “School Information” section on your I-20. My DS-160 application requires for me to include the address where I will stay in the U.S. and a contact person. However, my address in the U.S. has not been finalized. If your address in the U.S. is not available yet, you can use the Northeastern University address: Office of Global Services 354 Richards Hall 360 Huntington Avenue Boston, MA 02115 [email protected] For a contact person, you can put the name of the person who signed your I-20. You can find this information under “School Attestation” on your I-20. I am a new initial F-1 student who will enter the U.S. for the first time. Do I need a travel signature? A travel signature is not needed when you enter the U.S. for your program of studies for the first time.",

Denials 214(b) Denial Although F-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their students and any qualifying periods of post-completion OPT or STEM OPT. The F-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer’s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when an F-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your F-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. PP 10043 Denial On May 29, 2020, a Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China’s “military-civil fusion strategy.” This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected. Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations. If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance. Students should review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials. Administrative Processing The outcome of some F-1 visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as “ Administrative Processing .” Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months. In these cases, the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. You should follow the instructions listed on the 221(g) notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance. What is “Administrative Processing”? After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including: Your country of birth or citizenship Academic or employment history, including military experience Travel history Source of funding Past U.S. immigration records Family members’ backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence Geopolitical factors These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn’t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields. Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa. Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process. If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment. Next Steps During Administrative Processing If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process. Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing."

The process to request an expedited F-1 visa interview varies by location. You should refer to the instructions on the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will interview, or on their online appointment scheduling site. You will need to provide proof of the need for an earlier appointment (such as your I-20 showing a program start date within 60 days). Please note : You must first submit the online visa application form (DS-160), pay the application fee, and schedule the first available interview appointment. Only at this point will a consular section consider your request for an expedited appointment."

In most cases, the officer notes “D/S” (Duration of Status) on your passport pages. This means you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the length of time indicated on your I-20, provided that you maintain full-time enrollment and a valid F-1 visa status. Ensure your passport is properly stamped before exiting the immigration inspection area. Do not enter the U.S. in visitor status (B-1/B-2, WT, or WB). This status does not permit full-time study in the U.S. After your arrival, print your Admission (I-94) number at cbp.gov/I94 and keep a copy of all travel documents (I-94 information, F-1 visa, and I-20) for your personal records. Ensure your I-94 print out contains the correct information, including F-1 visa status and “Duration of Status.”"

If so, you may need to travel with a J-1 student visa. About the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program The J-1 Exchange Visitor Program, also called “ BridgeUSA ,” was established by the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (The Fulbright-Hays Act) and is administered by the U.S. Department of State to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and cultural exchanges. We encourage all J-1 visa applicants to review the BridgeUSA website linked above, as well as the Department of State Exchange Visitor Program Welcome Brochure . J-1 Visa Eligibility In order to qualify for a J-1 visa and be eligible to request a Form DS-2019 from Northeastern University, prospective J-1 visa applicants must: Be financed directly or indirectly by the U.S. government, the government of their home country, an international organization of which the United States is a member by treaty or statute, or supported substantially by funding from any source other than personal or family funds ( greater than 50% of your funding must be from non-personal or family sources ). Participate in a program that has an agreement between the U.S. government and a foreign government, or according to a written agreement between Northeastern and foreign educational institutions, Northeastern and a foreign government or a state or local government in the United States and a foreign government. Be able to demonstrate the required amount of funding for the entire duration of your program in order to be eligible for a DS-2019. Requesting a Form DS-2019 If your source of funding for your degree program requires you to apply for a J-1 visa (such as a government scholarship) or you believe you otherwise qualify to apply for a J-1 visa for your degree program, please notify your Northeastern Admissions Office, who will contact OGS. If it is determined you are eligible to apply for the J-1 visa, OGS will directly email you instructions to submit a DS-2019 request.

        "content": "Requesting Your NU.in I-20 (F-1) Helping Students Engage with the World The N.U. in program is an experiential, academic program that expands students’ Northeastern education into worldwide locations. Because the first semester of the N.U. in program is spent outside the U.S., international students must read all the information to understand how this will impact their arrival to the U.S. when coming to the Boston campus in the spring term after the N.U. in program. I-20 Form for Spring Semester The I-20 form is a visa eligibility document issued by Northeastern University to certify that an eligible international student has met admission requirements for a full-time program of study and has demonstrated sufficient financial support for his/her studies in the U.S. This visa eligibility document is needed to apply for a nonimmigrant student visa at a U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate in order to obtain F-1 status within the U.S. NOTE: For students who are participating in N.U. in outside the United States, the I-20 lists your January program start date. You can enter the U.S. as an F-1 student up to 30 days before this date. Canadian and Bermudian citizens typically do not need visas to study in the U.S. However, you do need to request an I-20 and also pay the SEVIS fee. What Type of I-20 to Request N.U.in Outside the U.S. New international students who will be attending the N.U. in program for Fall semester outside of the U.S., should request a new initial I-20 for the upcoming spring term. They will start the U.S. portion of their degree program in January. The I-20 form will be issued for a January start. How to Prepare and Submit an Online Request 1 Required documents for the I-20 request e-form. They must be in digital format of PDF or JPEG: Copy of the identity page of your valid passport Financial documents meeting your program’s estimated expenses Currency conversion: If you are submitting financial documents that are not in U.S. Dollars, please provide a currency conversion from a currency conversion calculator and upload it to the e-form. Sponsor letter or affidavit of support (only required when your sponsor is a non-blood relative) 2 Accessing the I-20 request e-form Please see the Requesting Your I-20 page of the OGS website. You will be prompted to enter your myNortheastern username and password login. The myOGS I-20 request e-form will respond to your individual situation and guide you through the process. Please ensure that you check “Yes” when asked if you have been admitted to the N.U. in program for the Fall Semester. (Contact the Office of Global Services with any questions) What Do I Need to Know About My I-20? You will be issued a new form I-20 for Spring 2025 when you will be matriculated into your degree program. International students participating in the N.U. in program outside of the U.S. are not eligible for SEVIS transfer from previous institutions because the difference between the end of their high school program and the beginning of their U.S. portion of the N.U .in Program is more than five months. Please do not ask your high school to transfer your SEVIS record to Northeastern if you are participating in N.U. in outside of the U.S. Your I-20 from Northeastern will be a new “initial” I-20 with a new SEVIS number, which means that you will need to pay another SEVIS fee and apply for a new F-1 visa. Applying for the I-20 You can submit an initial I-20 request only after you have been admitted to a program at Northeastern University. For many students, this means that you will be able to submit your request prior to your departure to your N.U in program location in the Fall. You will also need to be sure to confirm other requirements needed by the admissions office before your I-20 request submission. At that time, you will then be able to submit an electronic I-20 request through myOGS. OGS encourages you to submit your initial I-20 request as soon as possible, ideally no later than November, to provide ample time for the issuance of the I-20 and your F-1 visa application process prior to your enrollment. Applying for the F-1 Visa We recommend that international students apply for an F-1 visa and attend a visa interview in their home country before beginning the N.U.in program. However, if you are not able to do so, and there is not time to return home prior to the spring semester in the U.S., contact the U.S. embassy in the country of the N.U. in program to check for the possibility of applying for an F-1 visa in the specific N.U.in location. Step 1. Request Form I-20 from Northeastern Step 2. Pay SEVIS I-901 fee online Step 3. Fill out the visa application online (DS-160) Step 4. Schedule a visa interview appointment online Step 5. Go to the visa interview at the U.S. embassy Step 6. Receive the visa stamp on their passport Scheduling the F-1 visa appointment is a responsibility of the student. OGS can issue you an I-20 form, but you will need to reach out to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate and schedule your visa appointment. For any questions or concerns we suggest that you contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate directly. If an appointment in your N.U. in location is not possible, you need to look into the option of returning home and obtaining your F-1 visa prior to your departure to the U.S. Note: For the “U.S. Point of Contact Information,” you can state the name of the Designated School Official (DSO) who signed your I-20 and if you don’t know your U.S. address, you can state the following address: (Northeastern University 360 Huntington Avenue Boston, MA 02115).

This means you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the length of time indicated on your I-20, provided that you maintain full-time enrollment and a valid F-1 visa status. Ensure your passport is properly stamped before exiting the immigration inspection area. Do not enter the U.S.A in visitor status (B-1/B-2, WT, or WB). This status does not permit full-time study in the U.S. After your arrival, print your Admission (I-94) number at cbp.gov/I94 and keep a copy of all travel documents (I-94 information, F-1 visa, and I-20) for your personal records. Ensure your I-94 print out contains the correct information, including F-1 visa status and “Duration of Status.” After arriving in the U.S., you will receive an email from OGS with instructions to complete your Immigration Clearance and Orientation. You should check your HuskyMail frequently and follow the directions by the deadlines provided. You can find more information about maintaining your F-1 status on the OGS website ."

        "content": "Students Studying in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe United States Dependents Family is important, so that is why the Office of Global Services (OGS) wants to make you aware of what documentation you will need when a family member accompanies you to the U.S. Basics of F-1 Dependents A dependent is a spouse or children (unmarried under the age of 21). If you would like to have dependents accompany you during your study in the U.S., you will need to indicate this when completing your I-20 request e-form as well as providing the following: provide a copy of the identity page of the passport for your dependent(s). show additional funding on your financial documents for your dependents: For your spouse: add $10,000 to the estimated expenses for your program of study. For your child/children: add $6,000 per person to the estimated expenses for your program of study. Applying for F-2 Dependent Visa New students may choose to apply for F-2 I-20’s for family members while they apply for their initial I-20. Also, current continuing students and students on Optional Practical Training may request an I-20 for a dependent by using the Request for Student and Exchange Visitor Information System I-20/DS-2019 . Once your dependent receives their F-2 I-20, they will need to schedule their visa appointment at a U.S. Consulate abroad. It may be possible for them to apply for their F-2 visas at the same time that you have an appointment to obtain your F-1 visa. You should check with the consulate you plan to visit for details. It is also possible for your dependent(s) to join you in the U.S. at a later time. Pay close attention to the important information below: Dependents do not need to pay a Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee F-2 dependents may not work during their stay in the U.S. Your F-2 spouse may study part-time, and F-2 children should attend school full time while you study in the U.S. Basics of J-1 Dependents A J-1 exchange visitor spouse, and unmarried children under the age of 21, are eligible for J-2 status. The day the child turns 21 he or she is no longer eligible for a dependent J-2 status. Each J-2 dependent must have his or her own Form DS-2019. J-2 visa holders do not have to pay the SEVIS fee. Each J-2 dependent may accompany or follow to join the J-1 exchange visitor in the U.S. while the J-1 exchange visitor maintains status. All J-2 dependents are required to comply with applicable federal regulatory requirements. Please see Maintaining J-2 Status section below for more information. After arriving in the U.S., to request DS-2019 for accompanying dependent(s), please submit Request for Student and Exchange Visitor Information System I-20/DS-2019 . Please note, you may need to show additional funding for dependent expenses. Obtaining a J-2 Visa Spouse and/or children (under age 21) will receive his/her own SEVIS generated DS-2019, with his/her own SEVIS number. The J-2 visa may be obtained by bringing the dependent’s DS-2019 form and proof of adequate funding to a U.S. Consulate. Proof of marriage for spouse and a birth certificate for each child may be requested for J-2 visa applicants. You are also required to complete a separate visa application form for each child, even if they are included on a parent’s passport. It is preferred that families apply for J-1 and J-2 visas at the same time, but if the spouse and children must apply separately at a later time, they should bring copies of the student visa holder’s passport with the J-1 visa stamp and his/her DS-2019 along with all other required documents. Maintaining J-2 status J-2 dependents may study part-time or full-time in the U.S. while the J-1 exchange visitor is in valid status J-2 dependents must also be covered by health insurance for the duration of the J-1 program J-2 dependent children over the age of 21 are no longer eligible for J-2 status and will need to change to another status if they wish to remain in the U.S. J-2 dependents may only work in the U.S. if they apply for and receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS). More information regarding J-2 work authorization can be found here .

Banking When you open a bank account in the USA, here are a few things to keep in mind: Look at the location of the branch offices and automatic teller machines. Compare banks’ monthly fees, fees for writing checks, whether the bank requires a minimum balance. Minimum balance requirement should be waived for active students under 23 by presenting a Student identification or visa. Most banking operations are done online; however, to open an account you should go to the nearest bank office and speak to a customer service representative. Present two forms of identification to open an account- your passport, visa, or foreign identification are examples of accepted documents, and proof of a local address bill, bank statement.

                "section_content": "Banking When you open a bank account in the USA, here are a few things to keep in mind: Look at the location of the branch offices and automatic teller machines. Compare banks’ monthly fees, fees for writing checks, whether the bank requires a minimum balance. Minimum balance requirement should be waived for active students under 23 by presenting a Student identification or visa. Most banking operations are done online; however, to open an account you should go to the nearest bank office and speak to a customer service representative. Present two forms of identification to open an account- your passport, visa, or foreign identification are examples of accepted documents, and proof of a local address bill, bank statement.

Purpose of Letters of Invitation For visitors to Canada, letters of invitation can help to explain the purpose or a reason for a visit to Canada and describe the details about a planned trip. For visitors that require a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) to visit Canada, it is a good idea to provide a letter of invitation to support the application. It is also good practice to have a letter of invitation ready to provide to border officers at ports of entry upon arrival in Canada to help demonstrate purpose of entry. This applies to all visitors if someone is inviting them, including visitors from visa exempt countries. A letter of invitation does not guarantee that Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will issue a visa or that Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) will allow entry into Canada. Visa officers assess the applications to decide whether the person invited meets the terms of Canada’s immigration laws. Similarly, border officers at ports of entry will consider all the relevant factors in accordance with Canada’s immigration laws, including purpose of entry in making the decision to allow entry. Writing a letter of invitation does not mean you are legally responsible for the visitor once they enter Canada. You should still write the letter in good faith and you must tell the truth and adhere to any promises that you make in the letter. Information to Include in an Invitation Letter A letter of invitation should include the following information: At the top left-hand corner of the letter, the letter should include the recipient’s details, whichever is applicable: “Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada,” “Embassy ofCanada-Immigration Section,” “Consulate of Canada-Immigration Section” or “CanadaBorder Services Agency.” The letter should be addressed “To Whom it May Concern or “Immigration Officer.” The letter should include the date it is written. The letter should be signed. As the person making the invitation, you should include the following information: Full legal name as it appears on your passport and provide a copy of the biographical page. Date of birth. If you are working, your job title, and employer. Your address, phone number, and contact details such as email address. Relationship to the person that you are inviting. If relevant, provide proof of relationship such as a marriage certificate or birth certificate. Describe your current immigration status in Canada and provide proof (e.g. copy of post-graduate work permit or study permit). Describe the program you are studying or studied, the campus you are studying at or studied at, date of graduation, and mention any relevant dates of significant events, where the event will happen, and provide proof that the event will be happening. Details about your family such as your spouse and dependents’ names and dates of birth. If you are helping to financially support a trip or part of the trip, include proof of funds such as an up-to-date bank statement. Information to include regarding the person you are inviting: Full legal name as it appears on the person’s passport. Date of birth. Address and telephone number. Purpose of the trip. Planned duration of the trip including expected departure date. Where the person will be staying and how the person will pay for the trip. After you have written the invitation letter, you should share it with the person that you are inviting, and they can submit the letter with their application and/or have a copy prepared for when they are entering Canada.

Academic Sessions Semester-Based Programs For semester-based programs, NU has three semesters per year: Spring Semester: January to April Summer Semester: May to August Fall Semester: September to December Please see a list of semester-based programs below: Master of Science in Computer Science Master of Science in Computer Science Align Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering Master of Science in Information Systems Master of Science in Information Systems – Bridge Master of Science in Information Design and Data Visualization Master of Science in Bioinformatics Master of Science in Biotechnology Master of Science in Cyber-Physical Systems Quarter-Based Programs For quarter-based programs, NU has four quarters per year: Winter Quarter: January to April Spring Quarter: April to July Summer Quarter: July to August Fall Quarter: September to December Please see a list of quarter-based programs below: Master of Professional Study in Analytics Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs Master of Science in Project Management Master of Professional Studies in Informatics Master of Professional Studies in Digital Media Master of Professional Studies in Digital Media Connect Scheduled Breaks Scheduled breaks are clearly outlined in the program map and academic plan of each program. The following information on scheduled break is a general guide and students should check their program plan for specific guidance that is applicable to their program. Spring Break One week in March for semester-based programs One week in April for quarter-based programs Summer Break (if applicable) Summer semester for semester-based programs Summer quarter for quarter-based programs Fall Break (if applicable) Five days at the end of November for semester-based programs Seven days at the end of November for quarter-based programs Winter Break Last two weeks in December First week in January (depending on final exam schedule) Always check your Academic Calendar for your scheduled breaks. Modified course map If summer is a scheduled break in your program but you choose to take courses and graduate in the summer semester, you’d be modifying your course map and summer semester will no longer be a scheduled break for you. For details about work eligibility during academic sessions, please check Working While Studying . Breaks in Studies or Leaves of Absence Except for scheduled breaks , as a Study Permit holder in Canada, you cannot take a break or leave of absence from your studies for a time period that is longer than 150 days. If you do so, you may be considered not actively pursuing your studies and therefore not complying with study permit conditions. IRCC allows for authorized leave, approved by Northeastern University, for various legitimate reasons. IRCC has outlined some of these reasons as follows: medical reasons or pregnancy family emergency death or serious illness of a family member any other type of leave your school authorizes Any other leave, or period of non-study, such withdrawing from your classes, or delaying your program start, while in Canada with a study permit, may be considered as an unscheduled break. Non-compliance may put your immigration status at risk and may further impact your eligibility for PGWP. Work Eligibility during Non-Scheduled Breaks and Leave of Absence You are not authorized to work in Canada if you are on a Leave of Absence – even if this leave is approved by Northeastern University. This includes on or off campus work. Leave of Absence and Immigration Implications In the event that you need to take a break and you are approved a Leave of Absence by Northeastern, you are advised to keep a record of the approval as you may be requested to provide the documentation to IRCC in the future when you apply for immigration programs such as a study permit extension or PGWP. It is important to keep in mind that IRCC will assess the reasons for your leave to decide whether you meet the condition of actively pursuing your study. The approval from the institution does not automatically satisfy IRCC with this regard. In general, if you will be away from your study for more than 150 days, you need to either Leave Canada, or Change your status to a visitor or a worker Please consult an International Student and Scholar Advisor of Office of Global Services Canada team for questions. You can find more information about taking an authorized leave of absence on the IRCC website . Definition of Full-Time for Immigration Purposes Current Students Students enrolled in graduate programs at Northeastern University are considered to be full-time students for the purpose of Canadian immigration if they are registered in 8 or more credits per academic semester/quarter, except during scheduled breaks. During scheduled breaks, students may choose to take the break or have part-time/ full-time course load if courses are available * . *Students are advised to verify with their Academic Advisor that they will have enough on-ground courses available in the remainder of the program before choosing to take classes during scheduled break. PGWP eligibility requires the majority of the program to be completed in person, in on-ground courses. Students on Co-Op Students are considered to be full-time for immigration purposes if both of the following are met: They are registered with the proper non-credit co-op course during the co-op term, as reflected on their transcript. They are doing a full-time (30 hours per week) co-op job during the co-op term. Students with Special Accommodations Students with reduced course load are considered to be full-time for immigration purposes if they have received official approval from the Disability Resource Center of NU for special accommodations . Graduating Students Students who have completed the final course towards graduation and while awaiting the letter of completion to be available are considered by NU to be full-time for immigration purposes.

                "section_content": "Breaks in Studies or Leaves of Absence Except for scheduled breaks , as a Study Permit holder in Canada, you cannot take a break or leave of absence from your studies for a time period that is longer than 150 days. If you do so, you may be considered not actively pursuing your studies and therefore not complying with study permit conditions. IRCC allows for authorized leave, approved by Northeastern University, for various legitimate reasons. IRCC has outlined some of these reasons as follows: medical reasons or pregnancy family emergency death or serious illness of a family member any other type of leave your school authorizes Any other leave, or period of non-study, such withdrawing from your classes, or delaying your program start, while in Canada with a study permit, may be considered as an unscheduled break. Non-compliance may put your immigration status at risk and may further impact your eligibility for PGWP. Work Eligibility during Non-Scheduled Breaks and Leave of Absence You are not authorized to work in Canada if you are on a Leave of Absence – even if this leave is approved by Northeastern University. This includes on or off campus work. Leave of Absence and Immigration Implications In the event that you need to take a break and you are approved a Leave of Absence by Northeastern, you are advised to keep a record of the approval as you may be requested to provide the documentation to IRCC in the future when you apply for immigration programs such as a study permit extension or PGWP. It is important to keep in mind that IRCC will assess the reasons for your leave to decide whether you meet the condition of actively pursuing your study. The approval from the institution does not automatically satisfy IRCC with this regard. In general, if you will be away from your study for more than 150 days, you need to either Leave Canada, or Change your status to a visitor or a worker Please consult an International Student and Scholar Advisor of Office of Global Services Canada team for questions. You can find more information about taking an authorized leave of absence on the IRCC website ."

During scheduled breaks, students may choose to take the break or have part-time/ full-time course load if courses are available * . *Students are advised to verify with their Academic Advisor that they will have enough on-ground courses available in the remainder of the program before choosing to take classes during scheduled break. PGWP eligibility requires the majority of the program to be completed in person, in on-ground courses. Students on Co-Op Students are considered to be full-time for immigration purposes if both of the following are met: They are registered with the proper non-credit co-op course during the co-op term, as reflected on their transcript. They are doing a full-time (30 hours per week) co-op job during the co-op term. Students with Special Accommodations Students with reduced course load are considered to be full-time for immigration purposes if they have received official approval from the Disability Resource Center of NU for special accommodations . Graduating Students Students who have completed the final course towards graduation and while awaiting the letter of completion to be available are considered by NU to be full-time for immigration purposes."

Students who are dismissed should leave Canada or apply to change/restore their status as soon as possible once receive dismissal decision. Students whose dismissals are overturned will need to apply for a new study permit and they cannot resume the program until a new study permit is issued. Work Eligibility After Dismissal International students are no longer authorized to work on their study permit on/off campus in Canada after being dismissed from their study at Northeastern University Canadian campuses. Students who hold a valid co-op work permit may not undertake a co-op or internship placement after dismissal and may not use their co-op work permit to work on or off campus. Non-Compliance Non-compliance with the law or regulation may result in enforcement action; that is, an exclusion order can be issued for non-compliance, per subparagraph R228(1)(c)(v) in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations. Any work that is done under the invalid study permit or co-op work permit after being dismissed is unauthorized. Engaging in unauthorized work or study may also negatively affect future applications that are made under the IRPA and IRPR. For example, a subsequent study permit or work permit may not be issued until a period of 6 months has passed, since the cessation of the unauthorized work or study or failure to comply with a condition, per section R221 and subsection R200(3). Academic Dismissal Appeal Please note that even if you are in the process of appealing a decision of academic dismissal, the Legal status and Work eligibility requirements mentioned above still apply to you. As the study permit becomes invalid on the day which the permit holder is no longer enrolled at Northeastern University Canadian campus, international students need to apply for and be issued with a new study permit before they can resume their study with Northeastern, followed by a successful appeal. Students who wish to wait for the result of the appeal in Canada should change their status to visitor on the same day they are dismissed. This can be done by applying to extend their stay as visitor in Canada . Students who receive approval from their academic program to be reinstated within the first 90 days of losing student status may qualify for study permit restoration . Please note you cannot resume the study until a new study permit is issued. Students who wish to study at another institution will need to apply for a new study permit.

Academic sessions For semester-based programs, NU has three semesters per year: Spring semester: January to April Summer semester: May to August Fall semester: September to December Please see a list of semester-based programs below: Master of Science in Computer Science Master of Science in Computer Science Align Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering Master of Science in Information Systems Master of Science in Information Design and Data Visualization Master of Science in Bioinformatics Master of Science in Biotechnology For quarter-based programs, NU has four quarters per year: Winter quarter: January to April Spring quarter: April to July Summer quarter: July to August Fall quarter: September to December Please see a list of quarter-based programs below: Master of Professional Study in Analytics Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs Master of Science in Project Management Master of Professional Studies in Informatics Scheduled breaks There are three scheduled breaks at NU Canadian campuses, dates may vary by program: Spring break: One week in March for semester-based programs and one week in April for quarter-based programs, Summer break: Summer semester for semester-based programs unless indicated differently by the college, and summer quarter for quarter-based programs Winter break: Last two weeks in December and the first week in January (depending on final exam schedule) Definition of full-time for immigration purposes For students enrolled in graduate programs, NU considers students registered in 8 or more credits per academic semester/quarter, except for scheduled breaks, to be full-time student, for the purpose of Canadian immigration. During scheduled breaks, students may choose to take the break or have a part-time/ full-time course load if courses are available. Students on Co-op Students are considered to be full-time for immigration purposes if they are registered with the proper non-credit co-op course during the co-op term, as reflected on their transcript. Students with special accommodations Students with reduced course load are considered to be full-time for immigration purposes if they have received official approval from the Disability Resource Center of NU for special accommodations. Graduating students Students who have completed the final course towards graduation and while awaiting the letter of completion to be available are considered by NU to be full-time for immigration purposes. Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × Q. Will a part time status on my tax form affect my PGWP? If the information on your tax form is incorrect, then that is an issue to resolve with SFS. If you were actually part-time during a term, then you may be required to explain this to IRCC on your PGWP application. If you were part-time during a regular academic term, then your eligibility for the PGWP may be affected. IRCC and CRA do not share information except for two situations: There is an investigation due to suspected fraud. You have applied for Canadian citizenship and IRCC needs to verify your residency and tax status to support your Citizenship application. Your PGWP eligibility will be assessed on your enrolment records with the Registrar’s Office and on the compliance report that we submit biannually to IRCC. Q. How will co-op be shown on my transcript? Will this affect my PGWP application? Your co-op will be indicated on your transcript in the appropriate term. If you believe that your transcript doesn’t properly represent what you were doing each term, then be sure to include a letter of explanation with your PGWP application. As an example, if you took a part-time course load while working on co-op, and your registration status for that term is showing as part-time, then include that information in your letter of explanation with your PGWP application. Q. How are summer breaks shown on my letter of program completion or transcript? If your program has a summer break, then this should be shown in the academic calendar for your program, or if you have a modified program, in your course or program map.  Studying part-time or full-time during a scheduled break in your program is fine, and will not affect your PGWP. Courses taken during breaks still need to be the majority on ground, as your program is assessed overall, including studies done during non-mandatory terms. Q. Can I get a letter explaining my enrolment status and showing summer breaks? You will receive a letter to verify that you have completed your program requirements, to support your PGWP. You will also need to obtain a transcript to submit with your PGWP application. If you have taken a part-time course load or an authorized leave or have another unique situation, you would need to explain and document this in a letter of explanation with your PGWP application.",

Assessment of Study Permit Conditions IRCC Officers should exercise their best judgment and take into account all relevant factors when assessing a student’s compliance with their study permit conditions. Enrollment at a DLI: A foreign national who applied for a study permit on or after June 1, 2014, must be enrolled in a DLI . Actively Pursuing Studies: As of June 1, 2014, all study permit holders must actively pursue their course or program of study, while they are in Canada.

Estimate of Expenses for I-20 Requests (2025-2026) Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × Can I study in a part-time course in Canada? From an Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) perspective, at a minimum, students must have part-time status with their institution to be considered to be actively pursuing their studies. However, one of the eligibility requirement s for Post Graduation Work Permit is the student must maintain full-time status in every academic session. Pa rt-time course load may affect the student qualifying for for Post Graduation Work Permit. How can I prove that I meet the study permit conditions? IRCC might ask you to prove you’re meeting your conditions, as part of a random check or if they have reason to believe you’re not meeting them. IRCC might ask you for the official documents from the university confirming: your enrolment status the reason for and start date of any leave you’ve taken the date you withdrew from a school or study program the date you were suspended or dismissed from a school or study program the date you stopped studying at the school official transcripts references from people who know you proof from a medical professional confirming the medical need for a leave from your study program document confirming your school has closed and no longer offers your study program any other document an officer finds relevant What does “non-compliant” mean? Non-compliance with study permit conditions may result in enforcement action; that is, an exclusion order can be issued for non-compliance, per Canadian Immigration Law . Non-compliance with study permit conditions or engaging in unauthorized work or study may also negatively affect future applications that are made under the IRPA and IRPR. For example, a subsequent study permit or work permit may not be issued until a period of 6 months has passed, since the cessation of the unauthorized work or study or failure to comply with a condition, per Canadian Immigration Law section R221 and subsection R200(3) . What if I take a leave of absence from my studies, how will this affect my status? Students may be required or may wish to take leave from their studies while in Canada. Office of Global Services Canada does not approve or authorize leave of absence. Students who wish to request leave of absence are strongly recommended to familiar themselves with the immigration implications with regard to taking the leave. For the purpose of assessing if a student is actively pursuing their studies, any leave taken from a program of studies in Canada should not exceed 150 days from the date the leave commenced and must be authorized by their DLI. Examples of reasons for leave include but are not limited to the following: medical illness or injury pregnancy family emergency death or serious illness of a family member change in program of study within the same institution, outside a regularly scheduled break dismissals or suspensions (dependent on degree of severity) postponed program start date (see Deferred enrollment for more information) A student on leave who begins or resumes their studies within 150 days from the date the leave commenced (that is, the date the leave was granted by the institution) is considered to be actively pursuing studies during their leave. If a student does not resume their studies within 150 days, they should do either of the following: change their status (that is, change to visitor status or worker status ) leave Canada If they do not change their status or leave Canada, they are considered non-compliant with their study permit conditions. Students studying at Northeastern University Canadian campuses are advised to work with their Academic Advisor if they wish to take the leave. They are also advised to keep a copy of any emails /confirmation regarding the authorized leaves that are granted, in case they need it for their PGWP application. What is maintained status? Maintained status (formerly called “implied status”) refers to a legal extension of an individual’s immigration status while waiting for IRCC to process an application for a new permit to remain in Canada. To have maintained status, you must submit your application to IRCC for a new permit before your current status expires. For continuing students, this means that you may be able to continue to study (and work if eligible ) beyond your study permit expiration date as long as you applied to extend your study permit before your previous permit expired.",

To learn the rules of the road in Canada, you’ll need to enroll in a driver-training program or review Ontario’s official road safety book . You can buy a copy of this book through Service Ontario. After studying it thoroughly, you can take the knowledge test. Proof of driving experience You can self-declare one year of driving experience, by showing a valid, original foreign driver’s licence. If you want to earn credit for more than one year of driving experience, you’ll also need an official letter from the foreign government or agency that issued the driver’s licence, confirming that the licence is authentic. This letter needs to be written in English or French."

A Study Permit is the immigration document issued by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) that provides permission for an international student to study in Canada. This permit is your status document while you are studying in Canada and you must make sure to meet the requirements of your study permit. See here for more information about the conditions under a study permit. It is your responsibility to ensure that your Study Permit is valid for the duration of your academic program in Canada. If you are from a country that requires an entry visa (TRV) OR an eTA, this will be issued for you upon approval of your study permit – you do not make a separate application for a travel visa. On approval, you will be given a visa or eTA and a letter of introduction to travel to Canada and you will be issued your study permit upon arriving at the Port of Entry in Canada. When to Apply The Study Permit application process can be lengthy. It is very important you apply for the permit as soon as you receive the Proof of Acceptance letter. We recommend applying a minimum of 3-4 months before your program start date. Be sure to check with IRCC to determine the estimated processing time based on your country of application. Proof of Acceptance (POA) Letter You will need your Proof of Acceptance letter (POA) (also called Letter of Acceptance) to submit with your Study Permit application. The POA will be available to download on your application portal, where you will also find your Admission Letter. Please note that OGS Canada does not issue POAs under normal circumstances . POAs are generated automatically in your portal and should become available to you 6-8 months before your program start date. Confirm Your Enrolment Once you claim your NU account, use your Northeastern credentials to login to the applicant’s portal using the link provided in your acceptance package. Payments International students applying for a study permit are not eligible to pay the first-year tuition in advance. They will receive a deposit invoice for $500 CAD. After confirming enrolment, you should receive an email (to both the registered email account and the NU Student email) from Student Accounts Canada with payment instructions. If you have questions about this process, please see here . After you make the payment using the payment portal, you will be issued a receipt within two weeks via email, depending on your method of payment, to attach to your study permit application. The confirmation email will be sent from the Student Accounts Canada team. Apply for your Study Permit Students may apply for their Study Permit via an online application portal or via paper application. You also have the option of using the services of an authorized third party application collection service, called a Visa Application Centre (VAC) . If you are able, apply using the online application portal, as generally, online applications are processed more quickly than paper applications. Estimated processing times per country are available on the IRCC site. All the information you need for the Study Permit application process is available on the IRCC website. This process is not managed by Northeastern University and we do not have additional insight into processing times or delays. If you choose to use the services of an immigration advisor or lawyer to assist you with your application, please be certain to choose someone who is legally permitted to represent you to IRCC. To determine if a person is an authorized representative, please read the guidelines here . Additionally, check the CICC webpage on top tips to prevent immigration fraud . Documents Required for Initial Study Permit Please visit the official IRCC website for the complete details. Please make sure to also read the visa office specific guidelines for your country of nationality. Provincial Attestation Letter On September 18th, 2024, IRCC announced master’s and doctoral students will need to submit a provincial or territorial attestation letter (PAL or TAL) to support their study permit application, in the 2025-2026 study permit application intake. Study permit applications submitted on January 22, 2025 or later , will require a PAL. If you have an offer of admission for Fall 2025, your POA should be issued shortly. Once you have your POA for Fall 2025, please submit your study application to IRCC no later than January 21, 2025. If you have a POA issued for Fall 2025 and you do not submit your study permit application prior to January 22, 2025 , you will need to obtain a new POA and request a PAL. Please continue to check this page for further instructions on requesting a PAL. Information on the process to request a PAL will be updated on our website site as soon as we receive information from our Provincial governments. We strongly recommend that all new admitted students attend one of the OGS Canada Study Permit information sessions prior to submitting your study permit application. Click here for more information on event dates and registration. 2024 Study Permit Applications: Study permit applications submitted in 2024 for programs on the Master’s level are exempt from PAL/TAL until January 22nd, 2025. If you have been admitted to a Northeastern University Canadian campus and you will apply for your study permit in 2024, you may continue to follow the current process to apply for study permit. You will not be issued a PAL and you don’t need to have a PAL. Program End Date/Completion Date You will need to use the estimated amount of time shown on your POA in the Length of Program section to provide an estimate of your Completion Date. For example, if your POA states: Completion Date: N/K Or minimum 20 months of full-time studies Then your Completion Date should be estimated as 20 months after your Program Start Date. We cannot provide students with a specific date , as the length of time varies with every student depending on co-op opportunities, leaves of absence, course schedules etc. You will be able to apply for Study Permit Extension if you ended up needing more time to complete the program. New Policy Updates – December 2023 As a reminder, starting January 1, 2024, the cost-of-living financial requirement for study permit applicants will be raised so that international students are financially prepared for life in Canada. Moving forward, this threshold will be adjusted each year when Statistics Canada updates the low-income cut-off (LICO). LICO represents the minimum income necessary to ensure that an individual does not have to spend a greater than average portion of income on necessities. For 2024, a single applicant will need to show they have $20,635, representing 75% of LICO, in addition to their first year of tuition and travel costs. This change will apply to new study permit applications received on or after January 1, 2024. Please monitor IRCC webpage for detailed updates of the proof of financial support for study permit applications. Co-op or Internship Work Permit You may also apply for a c o-op p e rmit when you apply for your study with your initial s tudy p ermit. You may upload your POA document as your “School Letter” to the IRCC portal as proof that Co-Op is part of your program. You may be given a Co-op work permit at the border with your Study Permit. For more information about co-op permits and work during your co-op see the Co-op Permit page. Next Steps If your application is approved, the visa office serving your country of residence/citizenship will issue you a Letter of Introduction. Please read through your Letter of Introduction/Port of Entry letter (POE) closely and carefully. Further instructions related to requirements for a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV), Entry Visa, or eTA will be included in this letter. Please note that it is imperative that you take any next steps outlined in your Letter of Introduction (POE) in a timely manner. Do not book your travel arrangements to Canada until you’ve received your Letter of Introduction. Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions ×",

Scam alert – imposter calls! If someone claiming to be a government official or law enforcement officer calls making threats such as deportation, beware! Hang up and report it! Here’s how it works A number appears on your caller identification that may look like a legitimate government number. When you answer, the person on the phone poses as a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services or other government official or law enforcement officer. The scammer (or scammers) will say there is a problem with your application or additional information is required to continue the immigration process. Then, they will often ask for sensitive personal and financial information, demand payment, and threaten you with deportation, arrest, or other negative consequences if you do not comply. The scammer will then order victims to make a payment – and will often order them to go to a nearby bank or store and withdraw money or purchase a prepaid card, gift card, voucher, money order or make some other wire transfer, money exchange, payment or withdrawal . (Note that the scammers are often able to direct victims to nearby banks or stores by using online maps to study the area in which a victim resides.) If you receive a call like that, hang up immediately. We will never ask for any form of payment over the phone or in an email . If we need payment, we will mail a letter on official stationery requesting payment. Do not give payment over the phone to anyone who claims to be a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services official. In general, we encourage you to protect your personal information and not to provide details about your immigration application in any public area. Steps you can take If you have been a victim of this telephone or email scam, please report it to the Federal Trade Commission . If you receive a suspicious email or voice message and are not sure if it is a scam, forward it to the the USA Citizenship and Immigration Services webmaster at ( [email protected] ). We will review the messages received and share with law enforcement agencies as appropriate. Visit the Avoid Scams Initiative for more information on common scams and other important tips. If you have a question about your immigration record, please call the National Customer Service Center at 800-375-5283 or visit https://my.uscis.gov/appointment to make an InfoPass appointment.

Understanding taxes If you receive U.S. source income, including wages, stipend, or scholarship, you will likely have federal and state tax withheld from your checks. U.S. taxes is a pay-as-you go system in that there may be automatic tax withholdings from your paycheck, stipend, or financial aid. This means that in some instances your available income will be reduced by the tax withholdings.

Meanwhile, if you earned any taxable U.S. source income, you may need to file a federal tax return with the IRS.

                "section_content": "Understanding taxes If you receive U.S. source income, including wages, stipend, or scholarship, you will likely have federal and state tax withheld from your checks. U.S. taxes is a pay-as-you go system in that there may be automatic tax withholdings from your paycheck, stipend, or financial aid. This means that in some instances your available income will be reduced by the tax withholdings. When you file your annual tax report in April of each year, you will calculate the exact amount of tax due. (Some years you may get a refund and in others you may owe additional taxes.) Who must file tax forms for 2025 tax season? Even if you did not earn any income, if you were physically in the U.S. on F or J status anytime between January 1st – December 31st 2024, you’re obligated to file a Form 8843 with the IRS (the Internal Revenue Service, or ‘IRS’, are the U.S. tax authorities). Meanwhile, if you earned any taxable U.S. source income, you may need to file a federal tax return with the IRS. Depending on your individual circumstances, you may also need to file a state tax return(s). Tax Filing Deadline: April 15, 2025 is the last day for residents and nonresidents who earned U.S. income to file Federal tax returns for the 2024 tax year. Who is considered Resident or Nonresident for Federal Tax Purposes: Generally, most international students & scholars who are on F, J, M or Q visas are considered nonresidents for tax purposes. International students on J-1 & F-1 visas are automatically considered nonresident for their first five calendar years in the U.S., whilst Scholars/Researchers on J visas are automatically considered nonresidents for two out of the last six calendar years in the U.S. If you’ve been in the U.S. for longer than the five or two year periods, the Substantial Presence Test will determine your tax residency."

Annual Traditions Every year you can look forward to special programming from OGS that celebrates annual traditions. International Education Week Every November, the Office of Global Services promotes a robust calendar of event programming across Northeastern University in celebration of International Education Week, a joint initiative of the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Education, which promotes global education and exchange experiences. With over 14,000 international students and scholars and hundreds of intercultural opportunities across the globe, Northeastern recognizes the interdependence among nations and values the diversity of our collective experiences, perspectives, and thoughts. This rich institution truly is greater than the sum of its parts. Thanksgiving Thanksgiving is a national holiday in the U.S. and Canada, similar to other harvest festivals celebrated in countries all over the world. We at OGS want to make sure that you are included in this national tradition and that you feel at home on campus. Check this page to see what events will be offered in late November! OGS Programming Pillars Building Community The Office of Global Services serves the international student and scholar community throughout their journey at the university and beyond. Often, OGS is one of the first interactions students and scholars have with a department on campus. It is our goal to provide a home-away-from-home for our students and scholars and a welcoming community where students can be their authentic selves, as well as celebrate and embrace our students and scholars. Some examples include: Global Student Mentor Program (GSM) Events and programs for students to come together to explore and learn about their campus/surrounding areas, such as kayaking in the Charles River, and providing opportunities to learn about and celebrate holidays in their campus country, such as Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, etc. Beyond Borders events to bring international and domestic students together to share common experiences and to learn about different countries and opportunities to study or learn abroad. Providing support to students and scholars during their transition to their campus country to create connections with campus resources, faculty, staff, and their peers Professional Skill Development The Office of Global Services aims to provide leadership development for the international student and scholar population to encourage skill building opportunities for their future. International students and scholars often have different cultural norms which can pose challenges in adjusting to the education or working system in their campus country. Through OGS programming, students and scholars can increase their skills needed to be successful in their program, the workplace, and more. Some examples include: Serving as a Global Student Mentor (GSM) Taking advantage of the International Education Series or Carnevale to develop and lead programming for peers Participating in workplace preparation workshops Intercultural Awareness/ Celebration of Diversity The Office of Global Services programming aims to promote intercultural awareness and diversity to the Northeastern community. Through student-led programming, OGS provides avenues for students to provide introductions to new cultures, allow opportunities for students to eng age and learn about other cultures, promote global citizenship, and provide a sense of belonging for our international students and scholars. Some examples of this include: Carnevale programm ing (OGS grant funded student programming) International Education Series programming Collaborations with campus partners such as Global Learner Support, Global Experience Office, Student Affairs, etc. Events and programs for students to come together such as the Lunar New Year Carnival, Instant Noodle Night, Ultimate Chopstick Warrior, Norooz, cultural shows, etc., creating entertaining ways to learn about and celebrate new countries or holidays Transition Programs Transition programming aims to support international students throughout their time at NU and in their host country. This programming will support students through the transition to their host country., a new education system, maintenance of status, mentorship, and more.  Some examples of transition programs include: International Student Orientation Pre-arrival and arrival webinars The Global Student Mentor (GSM) program Compliance and preparation workshops such as employment benefits, workplace preparation, etc. Hosting International Student Townhalls where new international students can learn about student experiences at NU Graduate student campus tours Photos from Past Events Learn More Previous Next",

Clubs who receive OGS funding must submit a short, written report after the event (within two weeks of the event) that includes: A few photos from your event Receipts from purchases made with OGS funds A summary of the event, including the number of people who participated, highlights of the event, and the key takeaways/outcomes of the event A short description of how the program contributed to the OGS programming pillar of intercultural awareness / celebration of diversity Timeline to submit your event funding request to OGS on Engage: As you can imagine, a lot of planning goes into offering so many events, which is why it is very important for student organizations to be aware of the proper timeline and process for hosting events on campus. Use the CSI Website for guidance. Below is some helpful information regarding deadlines: 10 weeks before the event date: For any event (virtual or in person) that will require the process for bids and/or facilities contract(s) (e.g., hotel, boats, conference centers and campgrounds). 8 weeks before the event date: For any event (virtual or in person) that will require the execution of all other contracts. 6 weeks before the event date: For any event (virtual or in person) that does not require the execution of a contract with an external party. 3 weeks before the event date: For smaller events your organization will be hosting. For Example: barbecue, fundraiser, open mic night, co-op panel, dance party, movie night, collaboration with another organization just to name a few. When in doubt, ask a CSI Staff Member. Reminder: BUSINESS DAYS: Monday – Friday during university working hours, which are defined as 9am-5pm. Submission of forms on the weekend or after business hours will not be seen until the next business day. You must select the checkbox that you would like to receive OGS funding for OGS to consider your request. Funding OGS will support up to one program/event per student organization for each semester (Fall and Spring only) that contributes to the OGS programming pillar of intercultural awareness / celebration of diversity. Funding can be for one stand-alone event, not an event series. – Organizations will be eligible to request up to $5,000 per event per semester, however $5,000 is not guaranteed if requested as it will depend on funding available based on all student organization requests. – Funding is based on expected event attendance in three different areas: on-campus space, food and drinks, and decorations and supplies. – The student organization is responsible for storing decorations and supplies before and after the event. – Funding is for events that invite students from outside of the club to join. Funding will not be given for regular club meetings. – No item substitutions will be granted after the budget is approved. – The table below is to be used for guidance only. Student clubs do not need to request funding for all areas below. — NUPD will only be funded for graduate student groups. Undergraduate groups should apply for funding from the Student Activity Fee to have NUPD covered. Breakdown of responsibilities Student clubs will work with CSI Program Managers and Advisors as they normally would for any other event. If approved, the OGS will provide some event funding, day-of-event planning and event management assistance."

International Education Week Every November, the Office of Global Services promotes a robust calendar of event programming across Northeastern University in celebration of International Education Week, a joint initiative of the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Education, which promotes global education and exchange experiences. With over 14,000 international students and scholars and hundreds of intercultural opportunities across the globe, Northeastern recognizes the interdependence among nations and values the diversity of our collective experiences, perspectives, and thoughts. This rich institution truly is greater than the sum of its parts. Thanksgiving Thanksgiving is a national holiday in the U.S. and Canada, similar to other harvest festivals celebrated in countries all over the world. We at OGS want to make sure that you are included in this national tradition and that you feel at home on campus. Check this page to see what events will be offered in late November!"

Often, OGS is one of the first interactions students and scholars have with a department on campus. It is our goal to provide a home-away-from-home for our students and scholars and a welcoming community where students can be their authentic selves, as well as celebrate and embrace our students and scholars. Some examples include: Global Student Mentor Program (GSM) Events and programs for students to come together to explore and learn about their campus/surrounding areas, such as kayaking in the Charles River, and providing opportunities to learn about and celebrate holidays in their campus country, such as Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, etc. Beyond Borders events to bring international and domestic students together to share common experiences and to learn about different countries and opportunities to study or learn abroad. Providing support to students and scholars during their transition to their campus country to create connections with campus resources, faculty, staff, and their peers Professional Skill Development The Office of Global Services aims to provide leadership development for the international student and scholar population to encourage skill building opportunities for their future. International students and scholars often have different cultural norms which can pose challenges in adjusting to the education or working system in their campus country. Through OGS programming, students and scholars can increase their skills needed to be successful in their program, the workplace, and more. Some examples include: Serving as a Global Student Mentor (GSM) Taking advantage of the International Education Series or Carnevale to develop and lead programming for peers Participating in workplace preparation workshops Intercultural Awareness/ Celebration of Diversity The Office of Global Services programming aims to promote intercultural awareness and diversity to the Northeastern community. Through student-led programming, OGS provides avenues for students to provide introductions to new cultures, allow opportunities for students to eng age and learn about other cultures, promote global citizenship, and provide a sense of belonging for our international students and scholars. Some examples of this include: Carnevale programm ing (OGS grant funded student programming) International Education Series programming Collaborations with campus partners such as Global Learner Support, Global Experience Office, Student Affairs, etc. Events and programs for students to come together such as the Lunar New Year Carnival, Instant Noodle Night, Ultimate Chopstick Warrior, Norooz, cultural shows, etc., creating entertaining ways to learn about and celebrate new countries or holidays Transition Programs Transition programming aims to support international students throughout their time at NU and in their host country. This programming will support students through the transition to their host country., a new education system, maintenance of status, mentorship, and more.  Some examples of transition programs include: International Student Orientation Pre-arrival and arrival webinars The Global Student Mentor (GSM) program Compliance and preparation workshops such as employment benefits, workplace preparation, etc. Hosting International Student Townhalls where new international students can learn about student experiences at NU Graduate student campus tours"

Required Minimum Funding Please be aware that the minimum funding required per year is the following: $28,000 for J-1 Scholar ($2,333/month) $14,000 for spouse ($1,167/month) $7,000 per child ($583/month) The total financial support declared above should match or exceed the estimated living costs for the J-1 Scholar and their dependents, if applicable. EXAMPLE : A J-1 Scholar with a spouse and two children staying for one year would need to show $28,000 for themselves, $14,000 for the spouse, and $14,000 for the children: $56,000 in total. Funding for J-1 Visiting Students J-1 Visiting Students can only use personal or family funds for up to 50% of the required minimum funding. This means that more than 50% of the required funding needs to come from Northeastern University, their home institution, or another funding source. EXAMPLE : A J-1 Visiting Student with a spouse and two children staying for one year would need to show $28,000 for themselves, $14,000 for the spouse, and $14,000 for the children: $56,000 in total. A J-1 Visiting Student would only be able to show half of $56,000, or $28,000, in personal or family funds. They would also need to provide at least $28,000 from Northeastern, their home institution, or another funding source. Guidelines for acceptable proof of funds Funding from sources other than Northeastern (private sponsor, government funding, scholarships, personal funds, etc.) will be considered towards meeting Northeastern’s minimum funding requirements, with the following restrictions: All documentation must be officially translated into English and the translation must be certified ; currency must be clearly referenced and converted into USD. If you are providing a bank statement(s), it must include the following information: official English translation account holder’s name currency amount available issue date (the bank statement cannot be older than 12 months upon receipt by OGS) If you have multiple statements, upload all documents in this category together into one PDF and attach the coversheet . Documentation must be copies of originals (please note that the U.S. Consulate requires original documentation during the visa application process). Sponsorship by family member(s) If the J-1 Scholar will be supported financially by a family member(s), please submit the following: Financial institution documentation, such as bank statements or letters, including name of the financial sponsor; documentation must be recent, and not older than 12 months upon receipt by the Office of Global Services (OGS) A letter signed by the financial sponsor attesting that the J-1 Scholar is entitled to the funds in the sponsor’s account Sponsorship by home country organizations In cases in which the documentation reflects a range in funding, OGS will use the lowest figure in the range, unless the J-1 Scholar provides a letter from the funding source indicating otherwise. If a J-1 Scholar is sponsored by his/her home country employer (e.g., during a sabbatical from the home university), the letter from the employer must state that the J-1 Scholar will continue receiving a salary while at Northeastern (salary statement alone is not sufficient). OGS retains the right to request original documentation or other means of clarification. Failure to follow the instructions above will result in the delay of DS-2019 issuance.

J-1 Scholars must stop all work and program activities as of the end date on the DS-2019. Please see below for important guidance on completing your J-1 program. 12 and 24 Month Bars and 212(e) Two Year Home Residence Requirement If you are subject to the 12 or 24-month bars on repeat participation , the clock for determining when you may return to the U.S. for certain types of J-1 programs in the future begins immediately after your J-1 program ends. Additionally, if you are subject to the 212(e) Two Year Home Residence Requirement , you may only accrue time in towards fulfilling that requirement in your home country after your J-1 program has ended. Please find more information about the bars and 212(e) in the links provided above. If you have questions about these requirements and whether you are subject, please reach out to OGS . Grace Period All J-1 Scholars have a 30-day grace period following their program end date during which they have lawful presence in the United States. The grace period is not denoted on the DS-2019. During the grace period, J-1 Scholars are only permitted domestic travel. International travel during the grace period will complete the existing J-1 record. J-1 Scholars who leave the U.S. during the grace period will not be granted re-entry to the U.S. with their existing J-1 visa and DS-2019, regardless of how much grace period time has passed. Reminder: J-1 Scholars are not eligible to transfer to another institution during the grace period. Early Departure J-1 Scholars who finish their program more than 15 days prior to the program end date on the DS-2019 must notify the Office of Global Services (OGS) by submitting an End of Program Notification . The End of Program Notification needs to be approved by the faculty host and the Human Resources Contact in the host college before OGS can make any changes to the program end date. J-1 Scholars will receive a new DS-2019 with the updated program end date. 212e-two-year-home-residency-requirement The updated program end date will determine the start of the 24-month bar and/or the 212(e) Two-Year Home Requirement for applicable J-1 Scholars. J-1 Scholars are not required to submit the End of Program Notification if: They are finishing their program less than 15 days prior to the program end date. They are transferring to another institution. They were approved for a Change of Status to a different class of admission (e.g. H-1B). Transferring to Another Institution J-1 Scholars may be eligible to transfer their SEVIS record to another institution from Northeastern if they meet that institution’s eligibility requirements. The J-1 scholar transfer process requires careful coordination between both the transfer-out and transfer-in institutions, host departments, faculty supervisors, and international offices. This process can take at least a month to complete and must be completed before your DS-2019 program end date, so please plan accordingly. In general, a J-1 scholar may be eligible to transfer out if the transfer meets the following criteria: The scholar will be engaged in research and/or teaching in the same subject area across both institutions In general, a change in the area of research or teaching is not permitted; the scholar must be engaged in research and/or teaching in the same area when transferring sponsors The scholar has sufficient time within the maximum duration of program participation allowed for the J-1 category J-1 research scholars and professors are permitted a maximum program duration of five years. As an example, if the scholar spends three years with one sponsor, they will have only two years of eligibility remaining with their new sponsor. If the J-1 scholar has already spent five years at their current sponsor, they will be ineligible to transfer. There can be no gap in between J-1 program dates The transfer of sponsorship from one sponsor to the other sponsor must take place immediately; the new sponsor must agree to take over J-1 sponsorship the day after the current sponsor agrees to end their sponsorship. There is no grace period between transfer institutions. Because J-1 program dates do not always align exactly with actual activities, the scholar should consult with international scholar advisors at both institutions in order to identify the best possible J-1 transfer date. J-1 Scholars requesting to transfer out must submit the J-1 Scholar Transfer Out e-form in myOGS at least one month before the requested transfer-out date .

Report to the Office of Global Services Upon Arrival J-1 Scholars must report to the Office of Global Services (OGS) upon arrival to the United States or transfer to Northeastern by attending J-1 Scholar Orientation. J-1 Scholars must attend orientation within 30 days after the program start date. Please see J-1 Scholar Arrival for more details. Maintain Up-to-Date Immigration Documents J-1 Scholars must have: A passport that is valid at least six months into the future at all times, especially upon entry or re-entry to the U.S. Passports must be renewed before they expire. Passport renewals are done through the Embassy or Consulate of the country issuing the passport. A valid DS-2019 Familiarize yourself with your current program dates. Program extensions are not possible after the program end date has passed. Please see Completing your J-1 Scholar Program for more details. An accurate I-94 admission record Class of Admission: J/1 Admit Until Date: D/S Retrieve an updated I-94 every time you re-enter the U.S. during your program. J-1 Scholars entering the U.S. by a land border should follow these I-94 application instructions . The J-1 visa stamp does not need to be valid to maintain lawful presence in the U.S. However, J-1 Scholars must have a valid J-1 visa to enter the U.S. anytime they travel internationally. OGS recommends keeping scanned and hard copies of all immigration documents. Report Changes to Your Information J-1 Scholars must report any changes to their address and/or U.S. phone number to OGS within 10 calendar days of the change by submitting a Contact Information Update e-form in their myOGS account (see the “Scholars and Researchers” section on your account main page). If there are proposed changes to your Northeastern appointment title, site of activity, or changes in the source or amount of your funding, you must notify OGS in advance of these changes. Maintain Active Health Insurance Federal regulations require all J-1 Scholars and J-2 dependents to obtain health insurance for the duration of their program. J-1 Scholars who extend their program duration must ensure that their health insurance is extended to cover their stay. Please see Health Insurance Requirements for J-1 Scholars for more details. Please note that willful failure to have and maintain health insurance that meets the J-1 visa requirements may result in program termination. Comply with Department of State Restrictions on Hybrid/Remote Work Per Department of State Guidance Directive 2023-01 released on June 8, 2023, effective July 1, 2023 , exchange visitors in the research scholar, professor, and short-term scholar categories must engage in their activities at Northeastern in-person, on-campus, a minimum of 60% of the time . This means that you may work remotely no more than 40% of your regular work hours (a maximum of 2 out of 5 regular work days per week). Obtain Authorization for Incidental Employment J-1 Scholars are only authorized to engage in the activity for which their DS-2019 has been issued. J-1 Scholars may be eligible to engage in additional, incidental employment if they request authorization from OGS in advance and if the requested activity meets certain eligibility requirements. NOTE: J-1 Visiting Students are typically NOT permitted to engage in outside employment. Occasional lectures and consultations J-1 Scholars can engage in occasional lectures and consultations as long as the activity: Is directly related to the J-1 Scholar’s program objective at Northeastern University. Is incidental to the J-1 Scholar’s work at Northeastern University. Does not interfere with the J-1 Scholar’s program completion date on the DS-2019. Is approved and documented in SEVIS prior to its start date. If the incidental employment pays an honorarium, stipend, or similar type of one-time payment, the J-1 Scholar must be paid as an independent contractor . J-1 Scholars cannot engage in incidental employment as salaried employees. Reimbursements : J-1 scholars do not need to be paid as independent contractors if they will only be receiving a reimbursement and no other compensation/honorarium for the authorized activity. However, you still must submit an incidental employment request in advance, as many organizations will require a letter from OGS in order to authorize your reimbursement. How to obtain incidental employment authorization J-1 Scholars can request work authorization by submitting the Incidental Employment Authorization Request at least 10 business days prior to the anticipated employment start date . If you request is not approved by the employment start date, do not start working until you have received confirmation of authorization from OGS. As part of the Incidental Employment Authorization Request, J-1 Scholars must submit support letters from both the faculty host at Northeastern and the institution where they will be engaging in incidental employment. >> Sample letter for Northeastern faculty host >> Sample letter for outside institution J-1 Scholars approved for incidental employment will receive a confirmation letter and an updated DS-2019 if the incidental employment will provide additional funding. Consequences of unauthorized employment J-1 Scholars who engage in unauthorized employment are not able to obtain retroactive work authorization from OGS. Any work done without proper work authorization is considered unauthorized employment. Failure to request work authorization prior to the start of any incidental employment – paid or unpaid – may lead to the termination of your SEVIS record. Failure to maintain J-1 status may be considered unlawful presence by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Out-of-Country for More Than 30 Days The out-of-country functionality in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) allows J-1 Scholars to maintain an active record while outside of the U.S. for a scheduled period of time that exceeds 30 days. In order to be authorized for an absence of more than 30 days, J-1 Scholars must provide documentation showing that they will continue to engage in their program activities while they are away. How to report out-of-country to OGS J-1 Scholars can notify OGS of their plans to be outside of the U.S. for more than 30 days by submitting the Out of Country Request Form at least 10 business days prior to the anticipated departure date . OGS is not able to submit travel dates to SEVIS retroactively. It is at OGS’ discretion whether or not to approve an out-of-country request. During the J-1 Scholar’s absence, Northeastern University continues to be the program sponsor. Therefore, J-1 Scholars must demonstrate that they will continue pursuing the program objective originally described in the appointment letter issued by the host college. As part of the Out-of-Country Authorization Request, the faculty host will have to provide a support letter attesting to the J-1 Scholar’s activities while outside of the U.S. J-2 dependents must depart the U.S. with the J-1 Scholar for the duration of the out-of-country request. J-1 Scholars are not required to request out-of-country authorization if: They are vacationing outside the U.S. for 30 days or less with the permission of their department. Benefited employees are subject to Northeastern University’s paid time off policy . The J-1 Scholar is an instructor and will be outside the U.S. during a term in which the department does not require them to teach, but will return in the following term to resume teaching. J-1 Scholars who will be outside of the U.S. for more than 30 days and will not be engaging in their program activities may not be eligible to continue their program, in which case OGS will update the program end date in the SEVIS record to reflect the date of departure from the U.S. The updated program end date will determine the start of the 24-month bar and the 212(e) Two-Year Home Residency Requirement for applicable J-1 Scholars. During their absence, J-1 Scholars must: Maintain status and comply with the Exchange Visitor Program regulations. Report any changes to the information submitted in the Out-of-Country Authorization Request. Maintain both a permanent (foreign) address and current (U.S.) address and update them within 10 days after any changes. Maintain a @northeastern.edu e-mail address. During the J-1 Scholar’s absence, the host college must: Continue supervising the J-1 Scholar while they are outside of the U.S. Notify OGS of any changes to the information submitted in the Out-of-Country Authorization Request. A valid travel signature is required on the DS-2019, in addition to a valid passport and J-1 visa, in order to return to the U.S. IMPORTANT: If you will be conducting work related to your Northeastern University position outside the U.S., you and your Northeastern supervisor may be required to submit a Temporary Remote Work Request Form to the Global Mobility Office. The Global Mobility Office reviews these requests to ensure compliance with labor and taxation laws related to remote work performed while abroad . If you meet any of the following criteria, please discuss your travel with your supervisor and submit a request to the Global Mobility Office at least 3 weeks prior to the anticipated start date or remote work: Full-time, benefits-eligible, U.S. or Canada-based employee Traveling to home country for a valid reason (e.g., family event, health-related needs, emergency, etc.) Plan to work remotely for 15 days [2 weeks] or longer outside of the U.S. Has valid immigration documentation for re-entry to the U.S. Please also note that for all university-related travel (not including travel during personal vacation time), all Northeastern students, faculty, and staff are required to register their itinerary prior to departure in accordance with the Policy Requiring Registration of University Travel . Please see the Global Safety Office Travel Registry for instructions and more information. Request DS-2019 Extensions In A Timely Manner If your host department will be extending your appointment/position at Northeastern, your HR contact must initiate a DS-2019 Program Extension Request in myOGS at least one month before your current DS-2019 program end date . Extensions are not possible after your DS-2019 program end date has passed. Please see below for an overview of the DS-2019 Program Extension Process : Your host department extends your appointment/position at Northeastern The HR Contact in your host department initiates a DS-2019 Program Extension e-form in myOGS You will receive an e-form to complete for your extension Once you submit your extension e-form, your request is routed to OGS for review within 10 business days . When your request is approved, OGS will email your updated DS-2019 reflecting updated finances and new program end date. OGS will also automatically reverify your I-9 through the new DS-2019 program end date. No I-9 appointment or document upload is required for program extensions. Please Note : you are permitted to remain in the U.S. as long as your DS-2019 remains valid. After a DS-2019 program extension, your DS-2019 validity period extends, allowing you to remain in the U.S. to continue your program, even if the J-1 visa sticker in your passport is expired. OGS does not recommend you travel internationally to renew the visa simply because it has expired, unless you have other legitimate reasons for international travel. In that case, you must have a valid J-1 visa sticker in your passport in order to re-enter the U.S. after international travel. Please see the travel page for more information.

In that case, you must have a valid J-1 visa sticker in your passport in order to re-enter the U.S. after international travel. Please see the travel page for more information."

They have not reached the maximum program duration for their J-1 category by their transfer date to Northeastern. There will be no change in the program objective. There is no gap between the program end date at the transfer-out institution and the program start date at Northeastern. In addition to steps 1-3 above, transfer-in J-1 Scholars must also submit the SEVIS Record Transfer-In Form in addition to the required e-forms. Changing institutions requires coordination between the HR Contact, OGS, and the transfer-out institution.

Visiting Appointments (Visiting Student, Visiting Scholar, Visiting Faculty) are subject to approval by the Provost Office. The DS-2019 request involves several steps, requiring approval by your NU faculty supervisor, your host department, and several e-forms for you to complete as the prospective scholar. OGS does not receive the completed request for review until all required e-forms are completed. 2 Initial DS-2019: 15 business day processing time Initial DS-2019 requests are subject to a 15 business day processing time from the date the HR Contact submits the entire request to the Office of Global Services (OGS). Once your DS-2019 is ready, you will receive an e-mail that contains Northeastern’s J-1 Exchange Visitor Program Number and your SEVIS ID. This information is required to schedule a visa appointment at the United States Embassy or Consulate. Upon approval of your DS-2019 request, you will receive an email from OGS with your digitally-signed DS-2019 attached. If you requested a DS-2019 for your dependent(s) (spouse or unmarried children under age 21) to apply for a J-2 visa, their DS-2019(s) will be included with yours. Your DS-2019 approval email will include important information about next steps for making your visa appointment, housing resources, and what to expect as your start date is approaching. Please be sure to read the email carefully. 3 Carefully Review the DS-2019 Carefully review the DS-2019 immediately upon receipt and contact OGS if there are any errors or anything is missing (e.g. dependents’ DS-2019s). Sign and date in blue ink where indicated on the bottom of Page 1. Do not make any other notations on the form. J-2 dependents must sign their own DS-2019, with the exception of children under the age of 16; you must sign their DS-2019 for them. 4 Pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee For more information on the SEVIS fee, please visit ice.gov/sevis/i901 . The SEVIS fee is required for prospective J-1 Scholars who are applying for an initial J-1 visa from outside the U.S. The SEVIS fee is not required: If you are currently in active J-1 status in the U.S. If you are transferring to a new J-1 sponsor For J-2 dependents 5 Apply for the J-1 Visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate Abroad You can find information about the process and requirements for applying for a J-1 visa on the Department of State website . Submit the Form DS-160 following instructions on the U.S. Embassy/Consulate website. NOTE: Visiting Students do NOT need to submit a Form DS-7002 training plan. Make an appointment for your J-1 visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate . The U.S. Department of State has published estimated Global Visa Wait Times on their website. You will need to pay the non-immigrant visa application processing fee online to the Department of State. For information about the visa application fee and payment options, please check with your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate. The following documents are typically required for the J-1 visa application and interview: Fees: Online Non-immigrant Visa Application Form (DS-160) Confirmation Page If your address in the U.S. is not available yet, you can use the Northeastern University address: Office of Global Services, 354 Richards Hall, 360 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115.

Phone: +1-617-373-2310. Machine Readable Visa (MRV) Fee Receipt (visit the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate website for specific instructions) ( $185 as of May 2024 ) I-901 Student & Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) Fee Receipt ( $220 as of May 2024 ) Visa Reciprocity Fee (If Applicable) Form DS-2019 issued by the Office of Global Services (OGS) at Northeastern Signed by OGS in Item 7; printed, signed and dated by the exchange visitor at the bottom of Page 1. Valid passport (the passport should be valid for at least six months after your date of entry into the U.S.) Documentation evidencing financial ability to meet expenses (as noted on your DS-2019) Evidence of English ability sufficient for the exchange program Evidence of residence abroad and intent to depart the U.S. after completion of program A copy of your appointment/offer letter to Northeastern University One photograph ( see the U.S. Department of State website for photo requirements ) Please note : Expedited Appointments : if you make a J-1 visa visa appointment but the appointment date is after your DS-2019 program start date or does not give you sufficient time to arrive in the U.S. by the start date, please contact the U.S. Embassy/Consulate where you will be applying or check their website for their expedited appointment requirements. At many consulates, if you have a DS-2019 with a start date within 60 days and have already made a visa appointment, you may qualify for an expedited appointment. J-1 Scholars must obtain their J-1 visa prior to traveling to the U.S. In anticipation of your visa appointment, please follow the J-1 visa application instructions specific to your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Requirements may differ among Embassy or Consulate locations. Possession of a DS-2019 does not guarantee a J-1 visa. Citizens of Canada or Bermuda are not required to obtain a J-1 visa stamp, but they must carry and present their J-1 documents, including the SEVIS fee receipt, when entering the U.S. OGS strongly advises against purchasing flights or making other arrangements prior to receiving your J-1 visa. OGS will not expedite DS-2019 requests based on flights or living arrangements. J-1 Transfers to Northeastern If your J-1 SEVIS record is being transferred to Northeastern University, you do not need to pay the SEVIS fee again, if you have already paid it. If you are transferring from a U.S.-government sponsored Exchange Visitor program (indicated by a program code starting with “G,” such as G-1-0001) to Northeastern University, you are required to pay the I-901 SEVIS fee upon completion of the transfer process and before applying for a new J-1 visa. If you are traveling internationally after your transfer to Northeastern is completed, you must plan to apply for a new J-1 visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad the next time you travel internationally. Please note: you can remain in the U.S. with the J-1 visa stamp noting the previous institution as long as your new Northeastern DS-2019 remains valid. You do not need to depart the U.S. simply to renew the visa stamp unless you have a requirement to travel internationally. Please note that it is not possible to apply for a J-1 visa in the U.S. Administrative Processing & Visa Denials Administrative Processing & Visa Refusals Although most J-1 visa applications are approved, the outcome of some J-1 visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as “Administrative Processing.” In these cases, the consular officer will convey to the applicant whether the applicant is required to provide any further documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. Additionally, for J-1 scholars conducting research in certain STEM fields, your application may undergo additional security screening as part of administrative processing. This can often take several months and it is difficult to get updates from the Embassy during that time. You should follow the instructions on the 221(g) to provide any requested information or documentation. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, or if the 221(g) will delay your arrival to the U.S. to start your J-1 program, please contact [email protected] . Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing. Visa Denials Although J-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their J-1 program. The J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer’s questions, and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a J-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. You can apply again for the J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa refusals and visa denials. If you receive a visa denial that will prevent you from coming to the U.S. to begin or continue your J-1 program, please email your Northeastern HR contact & faculty supervisor, and copy [email protected] to notify us that you will not be starting your program. Change of Status to J-1 Within The U.S. Overview This section includes information on how to apply for a change of status while remaining inside the U.S. If you are currently in the U.S. holding a visa type other than J-1, and are unable or choose not to change to J-1 status through traveling and applying for the J-1 visa abroad, you may choose to pursue change of status in the U.S. if otherwise eligible. The more common method of gaining J-1 status (as outlined in the first sections of this page) is through traveling and re-entering the U.S. in your new J-1 visa status. In this case, you must apply for a J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad. Applying at the local Embassy/Consulate in your home country is recommended. You can enter the U.S. no earlier than 30 days before the DS-2019 program start date. Depending on your situation, you may prefer to leave the U.S. to obtain the J-1 visa instead of proceeding with the change of status process in the U.S. If you currently hold C, D, K, WB or WT status, you are not eligible to change to any other status within the U.S., including J-1. If you or your family are currently in J status (including J-2) and you are subject to the Two-Year Foreign Residency Requirement INA 212(e) , you may not change status in the U.S. unless you have been granted a waiver. USCIS processing times for adjudication of change of status applications to J-1 are 4-8 months depending on the processing center. We stron g ly recommend filing “ premium processing ” (which includes an additional $1,750 fee) to expedite the adjudication of your change of status application to ensure you can start your J-1 program on time. PLEASE NOTE: The Office of Global Services (OGS) can provide genera l information regarding the process, requirements, and timeline for an I-539 change of status application, however, since this is your personal immigration application, we cannot assist with detailed question or assist you in filing the application. We recommend consulting with an experienced immigration attorney if you require assistance filing your application beyond the general information provided on this page. DS-2019 Request Process You will follow the same steps outlined in the first section on this page to confirm your appointment at Northeastern and initiate a DS-2019 request to OGS. Once you have received your DS-2019 from OGS, you may begin the process of submitting your change of status application to USCIS. Required Documents To request a change to J-1 status, you must submit the following documents to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) : A completed USCIS Form I-539 (and Form I-539 Supplement if you have a spouse and/or dependents who will change to J-2 status). See here for filing instructions . Filing fee of $370: You can pay the fee with a money order, personal check, cashier’s check, or pay by credit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions . If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. OPTIONAL: Premium Processin g – if you would like to pay an additional fee for premium processing to request that USCIS to provide a decision on your application within 15 days, you will need to submit the $1,750 I-907 premium processing fee. Photocopy of SEVIS fee payment receipt. Photocopy of the Form DS-2019 issued to you and all dependents, properly signed by you. Photocopy of your and any dependent family members’ I-94 record from www.cbp.gov/i94 . Photocopy of information page of your passport (and of each dependent included in the application). Please note: Do not send your original passport. Photocopy of the visa that you used to enter the United States. If there are J-2 dependent applicants, you must submit evidence of their relationship to you (example: birth or marriage certificate with English translation). You must provide evidence of residence abroad or other evidence proving ties to your home country. Proof of financial support matching the source and funding amount listed on your DS-2019 for the entire duration of your J-1 program for you and your dependents. How to File Your Application The filing location for your Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, depends on your filing classification and where you live. You should use the filing address listed on the USCIS website in the “Nonimmigrants and Their Dependents” dropdown menu. If you are requesting premium processing service for Form I-539, you must also file Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service , and review the “ Where to File ” section on that page. After Applying for Change of Status Once you have submitted your change of status application to USCIS, please email your receipt notice and approval notice once your petition is approved to [email protected] . Travel Considerations : You will abandon or cancel a pending change of status application by departing the U.S. while the petition is pending. Please also note that a change of status within the U.S. grants you J-1 status to remain in the U.S. and start/continue your J-1 program, however it does not grant you a J-1 visa stamp. If you travel internationally after approval of the J-1 change of status, you will need to apply for the J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad in order to re-enter the U.S. to continue your J-1 program. Review the OGS website for visa application information and travel guidance . Once your change of status is approved, follow the instructions in emails from OGS for viewing the J-1 scholar orientation and completing your researcher confirmation of arrival e-form. If your plans change or you abandon your change of status application, please email [email protected] . Important Information Maintaining Status : You must also maintain your current status while your change of status application is pending. Failure to do so may result in USCIS denying your change of status application. If a change of status application is not approved before the requested start date on your Form DS-2019, we must defer your start date to avoid SEVIS record cancellation. If the deferred start date is later than the expiration of your current nonimmigrant status, you may have to extend your current status; this is known as a “bridge” extension. We recommend that you consult an experienced immigration lawyer with questions about procedures and maintenance of status (including the need to file a bridge extension) during the pendency of a change of status application. I-901 SEVIS Fee : All exchange visitors must pay a SEVIS (I-901) fee before applying for a J-1 visa or acquiring J-1 status. If you are a Canadian citizen exempt from the visa requirement, you must still pay this fee prior to submitting your change of status application. You will need Northeastern University’s Exchange Visitor Program Number to complete the Form I-901. The number is: P-1-03057. It is important that you have a receipt for the SEVIS fee payment before applying to change your status in the United States, as you will be required to submit this receipt with your change of status application. *For payment options or for details go to https://www.fmjfee.com/i901fee/index.html . F-1 Visa Holders on Post-Completion or STEM Extension OPT : there are important considerations with the timing of your change from F-1 to J-1 in this circumstance. Please consult with OGS at [email protected] for advising. Renewing Your J-1 Visa You should think of the J-1 visa stamp/sticker/foil in your passport as an entry document to the U.S. You must have a valid J-1 visa in your passport anytime you are seeking entry or readmission to the U.S. If your J-1 visa stamp/sticker/foil expires while you’re in the U.S., but you are continuing your J-1 program and have a valid DS-2019 or received a DS-2019 program extension, you can remain in the U.S. even with the expired J-1 visa stamp . You do not need to leave the U.S. solely for the purpose of renewing the J-1 visa unless you already have international travel plans. If you do travel internationally after the J-1 visa stamp has expired, and plan to return to continue your J-1 program with a valid DS-2019, you will need to apply to renew the J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad in order to re-enter the U.S. to continue your program. Please note that you are not able to renew your visa while in the U.S. If you apply to renew your J-1 visa during international travel, please plan accordingly and communicate your travel plans proactively to your faculty supervisor and department, as some J-1 scholars may experience delays returning to the U.S. as planned if there are visa processing delays. The process of renewing your J-1 visa is similar to the initial visa process you completed before arrival, however depending on various factors, you may qualify for an interview waiver when renewing your J-1 visa. When you fill out the DS-160 online to renew the visa, your eligibility for an interview waiver will be determined. You will need to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in your home country for more specific guidance on the visa renewal process, interview waiver eligibility, and what specific documents are required.

Visiting Appointments (Visiting Student, Visiting Scholar, Visiting Faculty) are subject to approval by the Provost Office. The DS-2019 request involves several steps, requiring approval by your NU faculty supervisor, your host department, and several e-forms for you to complete as the prospective scholar. OGS does not receive the completed request for review until all required e-forms are completed. 2 Initial DS-2019: 15 business day processing time Initial DS-2019 requests are subject to a 15 business day processing time from the date the HR Contact submits the entire request to the Office of Global Services (OGS). Once your DS-2019 is ready, you will receive an e-mail that contains Northeastern’s J-1 Exchange Visitor Program Number and your SEVIS ID. This information is required to schedule a visa appointment at the United States Embassy or Consulate. Upon approval of your DS-2019 request, you will receive an email from OGS with your digitally-signed DS-2019 attached. If you requested a DS-2019 for your dependent(s) (spouse or unmarried children under age 21) to apply for a J-2 visa, their DS-2019(s) will be included with yours. Your DS-2019 approval email will include important information about next steps for making your visa appointment, housing resources, and what to expect as your start date is approaching. Please be sure to read the email carefully. 3 Carefully Review the DS-2019 Carefully review the DS-2019 immediately upon receipt and contact OGS if there are any errors or anything is missing (e.g. dependents’ DS-2019s). Sign and date in blue ink where indicated on the bottom of Page 1. Do not make any other notations on the form. J-2 dependents must sign their own DS-2019, with the exception of children under the age of 16; you must sign their DS-2019 for them. 4 Pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee For more information on the SEVIS fee, please visit ice.gov/sevis/i901 .

At many consulates, if you have a DS-2019 with a start date within 60 days and have already made a visa appointment, you may qualify for an expedited appointment. J-1 Scholars must obtain their J-1 visa prior to traveling to the U.S. In anticipation of your visa appointment, please follow the J-1 visa application instructions specific to your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Requirements may differ among Embassy or Consulate locations. Possession of a DS-2019 does not guarantee a J-1 visa. Citizens of Canada or Bermuda are not required to obtain a J-1 visa stamp, but they must carry and present their J-1 documents, including the SEVIS fee receipt, when entering the U.S. OGS strongly advises against purchasing flights or making other arrangements prior to receiving your J-1 visa. OGS will not expedite DS-2019 requests based on flights or living arrangements."

                "section_content": "Administrative Processing & Visa Denials Administrative Processing & Visa Refusals Although most J-1 visa applications are approved, the outcome of some J-1 visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as “Administrative Processing.” In these cases, the consular officer will convey to the applicant whether the applicant is required to provide any further documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. Additionally, for J-1 scholars conducting research in certain STEM fields, your application may undergo additional security screening as part of administrative processing. This can often take several months and it is difficult to get updates from the Embassy during that time. You should follow the instructions on the 221(g) to provide any requested information or documentation. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, or if the 221(g) will delay your arrival to the U.S. to start your J-1 program, please contact [email protected] . Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing. Visa Denials Although J-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their J-1 program. The J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer’s questions, and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a J-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. You can apply again for the J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa refusals and visa denials. If you receive a visa denial that will prevent you from coming to the U.S. to begin or continue your J-1 program, please email your Northeastern HR contact & faculty supervisor, and copy [email protected] to notify us that you will not be starting your program."

The more common method of gaining J-1 status (as outlined in the first sections of this page) is through traveling and re-entering the U.S. in your new J-1 visa status. In this case, you must apply for a J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad. Applying at the local Embassy/Consulate in your home country is recommended. You can enter the U.S. no earlier than 30 days before the DS-2019 program start date.

        "content": "Academic Life in the U.S. Higher education in the U.S. has a distinct style that can be quite different. We are here to help you understand those differences so you can be prepared to succeed at Northeastern. Classroom Culture You may find the American classroom culture to be more casual than that of your home country. Keep in mind, however, that every professor and class is different so be sure to pay attention to the standards that each of your professors set. Professors will list their office hours in the syllabus, a specific set of time each week that they are available for student meetings. It is common for students to attend office hours in order to form a connection with the professor and to address questions in the course content or concerns about the course. Consistent and respectful communication with your academic advisor is essential. Academic advisors will assist you in registering for courses and staying on track for graduation. They can also work with you to change your major or add majors/minors if you are interested in doing so. We encourage you to use academic resources such as Global Student Success , the Writing Center , Tutoring Services , and English as a Second Language Programs as often as you need. Please visit your individual college websites for program-specific tutoring programs and resources. Active Participation Active participation is expected in most American classrooms and is generally a portion of the student’s final grade. Students are expected to contribute to class discussions, such as making comments or critiques on assigned readings. Lack of participation can be interpreted as disinterest in the material or a lack of preparation for class. Regular attendance and arriving to class on time is expected. Absences or late arrivals can also result in the lowering of your participation grade. We recommend you read the syllabus of each course closely to determine how many absences are allowed in each of your courses. Come to class with all assigned readings and coursework complete and be ready to verbally share your thoughts. Get to know your professor’s style and expectations as they may vary from class to class. Independent and critical thinking As you pursue your studies, you will be asked to critique theories, evaluate evidence, identify assumptions in an argument, consider likelihoods, and challenge your own opinions. This style of knowledge acquisition is often referred to as “independent” or “critical thinking” and is a resolute expectation in American universities. Students are expected to form and share their own opinions and present a supporting argument. Disagreement is allowed and even invited as long as class discussion remains respectful. Academic integrity The culture of the U.S. places a strong focus on individualism, meaning that Americans value independent scholarship and original thought. Therefore, we have a conception of the “ownership” of academic thoughts that is very different from other cultures. In U.S. academic writing, it must be clear with whom an idea originated. References to other people’s work require citations within the assignment and on a reference sheet. Handing in written work that is not properly cited or directly copied from another source is referred to as plagiarism in the United States. Each instructor has different expectations regarding citations, so students should make sure to understand the expectations of their individual instructors.

Overview J-2 dependents who enter the U.S. in J-2 status and are currently present in the U.S. are eligible to submit an application to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) in order to work in the U.S. The processing time for EAD card applications varies, and can take up to 3 months. The application cannot be submitted until the J-2 dependent has entered the U.S. in J-2 status, and can only be submitted while the J-2 dependent is physically present in the U.S. The EAD card will typically be issued to match the length of the J-1’s DS-2019. If the J-1 principal extends their DS-2019, and the J-2 would also like to extend their work authorization, they will need to submit a new I-765 application to USCIS to renew the EAD. J-2 dependents are only authorized to work during the dates authorized on their EAD card. Both part-time and full-time work are permitted using a J-2 EAD card, however any income earned through J-2 employment should not be for the intention of supporting the J-1 principal. J-2 dependents are encouraged to include a support letter, written by themselves to USCIS, with their EAD application to clarify how prospective future employment will not be used for these purposes. Required Documentation To apply for an EAD, the J-2 dependent must prepare the following documents to mail to USCIS: G-1145 , e-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance Form I-765 , Application for Employment Authorization On item #9, leave blank if you do not yet have a Social Security number.

Best rating of A- or above McGraw Hill Financial/Standard & Poor’s Claims- paying Ability rating of ‘A- or above Weiss Research, Inc. rating of ‘‘B+’’ or above Fitch Ratings, Inc. rating of ‘‘A-’’ or above Moody’s Investor Services rating of ‘‘A3’’ or above. Note: Insurance backed by the full faith and credit of the exchange visitor ‘s (J-1 scholar’s) government meets this requirement. If you purchased health insurance in your home country or have insurance from your home institution or home government, please ensure that it covers all of the J-1 requirements listed above and covers you and any J-2 dependents during your entire period of time in the U.S. The Department of State requires the Office of Global Services (OGS) to confirm that all J-1 Scholars have health insurance that complies with the federal regulations. OGS reserves the right to request proof of health insurance at any time during the J-1 Scholar’s program. Important Note for Northeastern Benefits-Eligible J-1 Scholars Postdoctoral Fellows/Associates, Non-Tenure Track Faculty, and some other J-1 eligible positions at Northeastern are benefits-eligible, meaning you may choose to enroll in the Northeastern Employee Medical Benefits. Please note that Visiting Appointments (Visiting Students, Visiting Scholars, and Visiting Faculty) are NOT benefits-eligible . If you are a benefits-eligible employee, and plan to enroll in NU health benefits, please note that the high deductible Northeastern health insurance plan does NOT meet the J-1 insurance deductible requirement ($500 per accident/illness). J-1 scholars should NOT enroll in the high deductible plan. Please note that the Northeastern health insurance plans do not cover repatriation or medical evacuation . J-1 Scholars will either have to purchase repatriation and medical evacuation insurance separately or select a health insurance plan through a provider other than Northeastern (see next section below). An affordable plan for just repatriation/medical evacuation coverage is available here . If your appointment start date is not on the first day of the month, please note that your Northeastern health insurance plan may not go into effect until the following month. We strongly recommend you have a separate private insurance plan to cover you from your date of entry to the U.S. and for the first few months of your program until you have confirmation of the effective date of your NU benefits. Health Insurance Resources The following vendor has created a health insurance plan specifically for Northeastern J-1 visitors that meets all of the J-1 visa requirements: Gallagher Student Health & Special Risk NOTE : if you elect to enroll in this plan, you must choose the plan “ with wellness benefits ” as this includes both medical evacuation and repatriation. The additional vendors below also offer plans for international students and visitors. OGS is not affiliated with these companies and does not endorse any one specific provider. Cultural Insurance Service International (CISI) Compass Benefits Group Gateway The Harbour Group, LLC HCC Medical Insurance Services Insubuy Insurance Services of America (ISA) International Student Protection (ISP) Visitors Insurance Evacuation/Repatriation Coverage-Only Plans : The vendors above may offer plans that exclusively cover the evacuation/repatriation requirement. The vendor below also has a standalone plan that only covers evacuation/repatriation. If your health insurance does not cover this requirement (i.e. Northeastern benefits-eligible employees with NU employee health insurance), you will need to also purchase a standalone plan to meet this requirement.

Please note that Visiting Appointments (Visiting Students, Visiting Scholars, and Visiting Faculty) are NOT benefits-eligible . If you are a benefits-eligible employee, and plan to enroll in NU health benefits, please note that the high deductible Northeastern health insurance plan does NOT meet the J-1 insurance deductible requirement ($500 per accident/illness). J-1 scholars should NOT enroll in the high deductible plan. Please note that the Northeastern health insurance plans do not cover repatriation or medical evacuation . J-1 Scholars will either have to purchase repatriation and medical evacuation insurance separately or select a health insurance plan through a provider other than Northeastern (see next section below). An affordable plan for just repatriation/medical evacuation coverage is available here . If your appointment start date is not on the first day of the month, please note that your Northeastern health insurance plan may not go into effect until the following month. We strongly recommend you have a separate private insurance plan to cover you from your date of entry to the U.S. and for the first few months of your program until you have confirmation of the effective date of your NU benefits."

See the steps below. J-1 Scholar Eligibility Requirements Must have temporary academic appointment at Northeastern University (examples: postdoctoral research associate, research scientist, visiting scholar, etc.) Must have at least a bachelor’s degree with appropriate experience in the field in which research/teaching is to be conducted. Must have adequate financial support for all living expenses, including additional financial support for any accompanying dependents (family members). Must maintain health insurance for illness or accidents while at Northeastern. Must have sufficient English language ability to engage in J-1 program activities and function in daily life in the U.S. DS-2019 Request Process Your DS-2019 Form, also known as a Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status, indicates that Northeastern has invited you to perform scholarly activities and that we have created a record for you in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). DS-2019 application process involves the following steps: The host Northeastern department determines that you have the appropriate academic background, funding support, and English language proficiency and offers you an academic appointment with the university. The Office of Global Services (OGS) contact (SEVIS Contact) for the college works with you and your host department at Northeastern via the e-form process to collect all the required paperwork for the OGS so that we can prepare your Form DS-2019. When your Form DS-2019 is ready, your college mails it to you. Once you receive your DS-2019, you may start the visa application process. The DS-2019 includes dates and information about your intended scholar activities. You can find your unique SEVIS ID number in the upper-right corner of your Form DS-2019. If you have dependent family members (husband or wife, children under the age of 21) who will be traveling to the US with you, they will receive their own Form(s) DS-2019 to assist with their application(s) for J-2 visa(s). If all the information on the form is correct, sign your name in the appropriate space on the form. If you have J-2 dependents, who are receiving their own DS-2019 forms, they must sign their own forms (except children under the age of 14; you must sign their DS-2019 forms for them). Please present Form DS-2019 with other required documents to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where you apply for your J-1 visa. You should also present these forms to the Immigration Inspector at the U.S. Port of Entry when you arrive in the U.S. Transferring In from another institution Scholars who are currently in J-1 Scholar status at another U.S. educational institution may be able to transfer their sponsorship to Northeastern. The new Northeastern DS-2019 Form application process is the same as for new scholars coming from overseas (see DS-2019 Application Process section above), except that it will also involve the scholar’s current U.S. institution.Please note: transfer-in J-1 scholars will not be issued a Form DS-2019 from Northeastern until the OGS receives and approves the DS-2019 request and the scholar’s academic appointment at Northeastern and the SEVIS record release dates are reached. Understanding J-1 status Health insurance requirements All J-1 exchange visitors and their J-2 dependents are required by federal regulations to have medical insurance that meets specific requirements. You are able to pick insurance that fits your needs and your dependents, however, the insurance must meet the below stated minimum requirements: Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness In case of death, repatriation of remains in the amount of $25,000 Expenses in the amount of $50,000 associated with the medical evacuation of the J exchange visitor to their home country A deductible amount not to exceed $500 per accident or illness Health insurance options The options below are a collection of agencies offering insurance service in the field of international education. The Office of Global Services does not endorse any health insurance plan in particular. The choices and responsibility of selection and relation management rest with the J-1 exchange visitor. Insurance Services of America (ISA) Compass Benefits Group Harbour Group, LLC Gateway USA CISI – Cultural Insurance Service International International Student Protection (ISP) HCC Medical Insurance Services (HCC) Visitors Insurance (for search) Benefits are subject to change at any time. For complete and current information, please visit the provider’s website to ensure that you have the correct information. For J-1 scholars paid by Northeastern, please be aware that Northeastern University health plans do not include evacuation and repatriation of remains insurance. Scholars eligible for and selecting a Northeastern University plan must purchase evacuation and repatriation insurance separately (please refer to the list above if you need suggestions). Be prepared to show proof of Department of State mandated J-1 health insurance coverage during your program at Northeastern University. The Office of Global Services is required by the Department of State to confirm that the J-1 scholar has fulfilled their obligation to purchase the requisite insurance prior to providing any J-1 benefit, including but not limited to travel signatures, extensions, and transfers. Therefore, the Office of Global Services reserves the right to request both the policy name and number at any time. Home residency requirement The goal of the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program is to promote mutual understanding and cultural and educational exchange, with the intent that participants return to their home countries and share knowledge gained during the program. In certain instances, scholars in J-1 status are required to return to their home country or country of legal permanent residence for two years before obtaining a more permanent status in the USA, such as an H, L, K nonimmigrant classification, or becoming a lawful permanent resident (“green card” holder). In addition, scholars who are subject to this requirement are not eligible to apply for a change of status to another nonimmigrant classification while inside the USA. Scholars are subject to the Two-Year Home Residence Requirement – also known as 212(e) – if: They came to the USA to participate in medical residency under J-1 Alien Physical category OR They received direct government funding (from the USA or their home country) for the purposes of international exchange OR Their country has an “Exchange Visitor Skills List” and their field of research is on this list (Please visit travel.state.gov website for details) NOTE: That receiving a salary that is funded out of a government grant that is given for the purposes of conducting research but not specifically designated for the scholar’s exchange program does not result in the scholar being subject to this provision. Two-Year Home Residence Requirement (212(e)) can affect scholars in any J classification, including J-2 dependents. 212(e) is distinct from the 24-month bar on repeat participation in J-1 research scholar and professor categories which only affects scholars in J-1 research scholar or professor categories. Waiver of the requirement and advisory opinions In limited circumstances, exchange visitors who are subject to the home residency requirement may apply for a waiver directly from the Department of State if they meet certain conditions. The eligibility and required steps are outlined on the website of the Department of State . In addition, if the scholar believes they have been incorrectly subjected to 212(e), the first step would be for the scholar to file an advisory opinion as an initial inquiry. Before applying for a waiver, J-1 scholars are encouraged to contact the Office of Global Services and let an advisor know their intent of the waiver application. Failure to inform the Office of Global Services regarding this matter could jeopardize the J-1 scholar’s ability to extend their DS-2019 and remain at Northeastern. NOTE: The Office of Global Services can only provide general information about these two options. The Office of Global Services cannot directly assist or prepare documentation. 12-month bar Prospective Northeastern scholars who have been in the USA for more than six months in the previous year (12 months) in any J visa status are not eligible to enter the USA as a J-1 research scholar or professor for a 12-month period. Time spent in the J-1 short-term scholar category does not count towards the 12-month bar. The 12-month bar applies to both the J-1 principal and any J-2 dependents. The 12-month bar does not prevent individuals from returning to the USA in any other visa status or in some other J categories such as short-term scholar or student. 24-month bar Effective November 18, 2006, scholars in the J-1 research scholar or professor categories who complete their exchange program become subject to a 24-month bar or prohibition from returning to the USA to start a new J-1 Exchange Visitor Program in the research scholar or professor category. If the scholar anticipates that they will be interested in continuing research or teaching at Northeastern or at another USA institution, they should consult with the Office of Global Services regarding future potential options, such as extending the current program or transferring to another exchange visitor program outside of Northeastern. NOTE: The extensions or transfers must be planned several months prior to ending the J-1 Student and Exchange Visitor Information System immigration record. This prohibition does not apply to scholars in other J-1 classifications, such as J-1 Short-Term Scholar Category. This bar on repeat participation is distinct from the Two-Year Home Residence Requirement –212(e). There is no possibility of a waiver for the 24-month bar on repeat participation in the J-1 research scholar and professor categories.

If the scholar anticipates that they will be interested in continuing research or teaching at Northeastern or at another USA institution, they should consult with the Office of Global Services regarding future potential options, such as extending the current program or transferring to another exchange visitor program outside of Northeastern. NOTE: The extensions or transfers must be planned several months prior to ending the J-1 Student and Exchange Visitor Information System immigration record. This prohibition does not apply to scholars in other J-1 classifications, such as J-1 Short-Term Scholar Category. This bar on repeat participation is distinct from the Two-Year Home Residence Requirement –212(e). There is no possibility of a waiver for the 24-month bar on repeat participation in the J-1 research scholar and professor categories."

While volunteering may seem simple, it is actually a complex area in which immigration regulations and labor laws intersect. Complexities of volunteering If you are interested in volunteering, you must be aware of relevant F-1 and J-1 regulations, so you and the organization do not violate any rules regarding employment authorization. F-1 and J-1 students who are working off-campus must be authorized before engaging in the employment. Without proper authorization, off-campus employment, including some volunteering, would be considered a violation of your F-1 or J-1 requirements. The consequences may include loss of your F-1 or J-1 status in the U.S.—making it difficult to reacquire lawful status within the U.S. If you are considering engaging in a volunteering opportunity, please make an appointment with an OGS adviser before making plans to begin any activity. Volunteering vs. Unpaid Internship There is a difference between volunteering and engaging in an unpaid internship. Volunteering refers to donating time with an organization whose primary purpose is charitable or humanitarian in nature, without remuneration or any other type of compensation. F-1 and J-1 students are allowed to engage in volunteer work as long as it meets this stated criteria. For example, it is permitted for F-1 and J-1 students to volunteer at a local homeless shelter, charitable food pantry, or American Red Cross. Unpaid internships, on the other hand, do not usually qualify as “volunteer” activity. Internships, both paid and unpaid, are primarily offered by the private sector and related to the intern’s major field of study. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students are advised to seek work authorization prior in order to engage in unpaid internships. The Department of Labor in the U.S. has guidelines for those seeking an unpaid internship, please see here , the “Primary Beneficiary Test” outlined on the Department of Labor’s website can be used to determine whether or not the unpaid internship is considered employment. Because of the consequences of unauthorized employment, we caution all F-1 and J-1 students to consult the Office of Global Services when considering engaging in an unpaid internship or volunteering opportunity. Please make an appointment with an OGS advisor before making plans to begin any activity. U.S. Department of Labor's definition volunteering The Department of Labor is concerned both with the protection of jobs for U.S citizens, and with the prevention of exploitation of workers. They have created laws to ensure employment that should be paid is not done for free. While both you and the employer may be happy with an unpaid arrangement (for example, you may be eager to work even on an unpaid basis in a company in order to gain job experience), this may be considered an unfair arrangement in cases where the work is normally performed by a paid person and both the company and the employee are benefiting from the employment. How to determine whether an activity is truly volunteering and does NOT require work authorization Employment authorization is NOT required when the work performed can be considered volunteering. To be considered volunteering, the work performed by the individual must meet the following criteria: No compensation or expectation of compensation The volunteer cannot displace a genuine employee and the services provided by the volunteer should not be the same services for which he or she was previously paid and/or expects to be hired and paid for in the future Services are performed for a non-profit charity and the work is “charitable” in nature Services are performed for a state or local government agency and there is a “civic” purpose to the work Volunteering at Northeastern If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff/faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern, please review this guidance from Northeastern University Office of General Counsel. Due to the complexity of U.S. labor laws: all university departments, who want to have students volunteer within their department, are advised to thoroughly review this resource. If they have further questions on whether or not the engagement is considered volunteering, they should check directly with the Office of General Counsel. Related Articles: F-1 Curricular Practical Training J-1 Academic Training Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × Is it employment or volunteering? A common misconception is that the only difference is employees get paid and volunteers do not. However, according to U.S. labor laws, there is more to distinguish between employees and volunteers than whether an individual receives a regular paycheck or not. Work that is unpaid may still be considered employment that requires F-1 or J-1 off-campus work authorization. Who is considered an employee? The definition of an employee used in the context of immigration regulations is as follows: “An individual who provides services or labor for an employer for wages or other remuneration.” The term “remuneration” is very broad and includes a variety of non-monetary benefits, such as free housing, food, gifts, etc. Who is considered a volunteer? According to the Department of Labor, volunteers are individuals “who volunteer or donate their services, usually on a part-time basis, for public services, religious or humanitarian objectives, not as employees and without contemplation of pay, are not considered employees of the religious, charitable or similar non-profit organizations that receive their service.” To learn more, click here .",

        "content": "Students Studying in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe United States H-1B and the Cap-Gap Extension The Cap-Gap Extension extends an eligible F-1 student's status to “bridge the gap” between the end of Post-OPT or STEM Extension and the start of H-1B status, thereby allowing the student to remain in the U.S. during the \"gap\". What is H-1B Status? The H-1B is temporary employment authorization that is used for nonimmigrant individuals in a specialty occupation. In order to become eligible for H-1B status, an employer must sponsor an individual and submit a petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Each year, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a limit (cap) of 65,000 new H-1B visas for individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher being sponsored by a cap-subject employer. 20,000 additional H-1Bs are reserved for individuals with a master’s degree or higher earned at a U.S. college or university. Some H-1B visas are not cap-subject, including but not limited to those employed at institutions of higher education, nonprofit research organizations, or government research organizations. H-1B visas are adjudicated through a randomized system and begin on October 1 for cap-subject employers. You can learn more about the H-1B Cap Season here. What is the Cap-Gap Extension? The Cap – Gap Extension is an automatic extension of F-1 status that may be granted to F-1 students who need to “bridge the gap” between the expiration of their OPT/STEM EAD and the start date of their approved H-1B sponsored by a cap-subject employer. Because new H-1Bs become effective on October 1 of each year , the Cap-Gap Extension allows eligi ble F-1 students to remain in the U.S. between the expiration of their OPT/STEM Extension and the start of their H-1B. You can learn more about H-1B status and the Cap-Gap Extension here. Cap-Gap Extension Eligibility Please be aware that the responsibility of the Office of Global Services (OGS) regarding H-1B petitions is minimal. As an F-1 student, you may be eligible for the Cap-Gap extension if: You have maintained your F-1 status You are the beneficiary of an H-1B petition that was timely filed by an employer that is cap-subject The H-1B petition requests a start date of October 1st and a change of status inside the U.S. If you have applied for the H-1B via consular processing, you do not qualify for the Cap-Gap Extension. The Cap-Gap Extension is automatically applied to a student’s SEVIS record. As such OGS is able to provide proof of the extension only if a student has been deemed eligible by USCIS. If Your H-1B Petition was Filed During Your 60-Day Grace Period: If your sponsoring employer filed the H-1B petition during your 60-day grace period, your Cap-Gap Extension will allow you to remain in the U.S. until the start date of your H-1B (unless your petition is rejected, denied, or withdrawn). However, your work authorization will not be extended, and you must stop working as of the expiration date on your EAD. Please Note: Once your SEVIS record completes for the change of status to H-1B, your F-1 status has ended, and OGS is not able to “revert” your status back to F-1. You can learn more about eligibility for the Cap-Gap Extension here. How can I Request Proof of my Cap-Gap Extension? Please fill out this e-form: Cap Gap I-20 Request . NOTE: we recommend waiting at least 2 weeks after you receive confirmation from USCIS that your H-1B petition was filed before submitting this e-form, to allow the data from USCIS to reflect accurately in your SEVIS record. You will need to provide proof of a qualifying “pending” or “approved” H-1B petition. You can provide proof with either of the following documents: USCIS H-1B Approval Notice (I-797A) USCIS H-1B Receipt Notice (I-797C) Only upload this if you have not yet received your H-1B approval notice (I-797A) NOTE: we can only accept an I-797C if the notice type if “Receipt Notice” confirming the H-1B petition was actually filed. We cannot accept an I-797C for notice type “Registration Selection” (see the top right section of the notice) If your request meets all requirements outlined above, OGS will issue you an updated I-20 reflecting your Cap-Gap Extension of status, and extension of OPT/STEM work authorization if applicable. Can I Apply for the STEM Extension During the Cap-Gap Extension period? OGS DOES NOT advise students to submit an application for the STEM Extension after the expiration date of your OPT EAD, even when a student has received the Cap-Gap Extension. It is the experience of OGS and other institutions that applications for the STEM Extension have a very high rate of denial when they are submitted to USCIS beyond the OPT EAD expiration date. If a student chooses to submit an application for the STEM Extension after their Cap-Gap Extension has been applied but before their OPT EAD has expired , they are advised to also submit a letter to USCIS informing them of the date discrepancy that may exist between the actual OPT end date and the Cap Gap Extension end date (September 30). The letter should advise the adjudicators at USCIS that if the STEM Extension is approved, it must be approved based on the actual OPT end date, not based on the end date of the Cap Gap Extension. All students who request the STEM Extension after Cap-Gap has been applied to their SEVIS record will be emailed a template letter of explanation to submit to USCIS with their STEM Extension application. Students can also fill out OGS’ inquiry form to request this letter template. If a student decides to continue on their STEM extension rather than changing to H-1B, they must ensure that the employer requests the withdrawal of the H-1B petition prior to October 1. If this is not done, the H-1B status will begin on October 1 and the student’s eligibility for the STEM OPT extension will be cancelled. If a student decides to change to H-1B and not proceed with the STEM OPT extension application, the student should send a letter to the USCIS, requesting that the STEM application is withdrawn. Important Travel Considerations During the cap gap extension period, F-1 students should only travel internationally if all of the following is true : Your H-1B petition and request for change of status has been approved by USCIS. You seek readmission before your H-1B employment begins (normally such employment begins on October 1) You have all proper documentation including a valid passport, valid, signed Form I-20 with valid travel signature, and a valid F-1 visa. If you travel abroad before USCIS approves your H-1B change of status petition, during your cap gap extension period, USCIS will consider your change of status request abandoned and this could result in H-1B denial . If this occurs, you would not be able to re-enter the U.S. as an F-1 student pursuant to your cap gap extension, as your SEVIS record may auto-complete. Please see the USCIS page (click the “Traveling on the Cap Gap Extension” dropdown menu) for more information. We also strongly recommend that you coordinate all travel plans during your cap gap extension with your H-1B employer and/or the immigration attorney filing on your behalf. Unemployment During the Cap-Gap Extension Period Please note: USCIS has clarified that unemployment during the cap-gap automatic extension counts toward the 90-day (post-completion OPT) or 150-day (for STEM OPT extension) cumulative maximum allowed unemployment. H-1B Reporting There are many complexities that an F-1 student may experience when changing their status from F-1 to H-1B. If your status has already changed or will be changing from F-1 to H-1B, please complete the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form . An OGS Designated School Official (DSO) will review the request and review your F-1 SEVIS record to ensure any changes are reflected accurately. You should fill out this e-form : To report that your H-1B petition for change of status was approved (I-797A Approval Notice from USCIS) To report that your H-1B petition for consular processing was approved (I-797B Approval Notice from USCIS) and you have re-entered the U.S. in H-1B status. To report that your H-1B petition for consular processing was approved (I-797B Approval Notice from USCIS) but you have NOT re-entered the U.S. in H-1B status yet. To report that your H-1B petition was withdrawn by your employer. If you received a Request for Evidence (RFE) for your H-1B petition that requires you to provide information related to your F-1 non-immigrant status or academic background, please submit the H-1B RFE Response Request e-form . If your H-1B petition was denied , please submit the H-1B Denial Notification e-form . OGS will review the denial notice to determine if any institutional support from OGS or Northeastern is appropriate. Impact of Changing to H-1B from F-1 Status If you are approved for H-1B change of status, as of the effective date of the H-1B period (October 1 in most cases for cap-subject employers), your F-1 status ends and your SEVIS record automatically completes. Unfortunately, in cases where students lose their H-1B employment (due to layoffs, for example) after they have already changed to H-1B, there are typically no options to reclaim unused OPT/STEM OPT time or to have their previous SEVIS record reactivated . Students should carefully consider this when applying to change to H-1B status, and be prepared that they may need to consult with an immigration attorney for next options if their H-1B employment is terminated, and that simply reverting back to F-1 status is often not possible. Students whose F-1 status has or will be changing to H-1B status, or whose H-1B employment has been withdrawn, revoked, or denied, should submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form (or H-1B Denial Notification e-form ) as soon as possible so that OGS may review your case . If your H-1B was withdrawn/revoked/denied and you have questions related to your F-1 status, please also call OGS at +1 617-373-2310 to make an appointment with an OGS advisor. If your H-1B Employer Withdraws/Revokes Your Petition : Please review the information provided on the USCIS website . If your employer can provide evidence that USCIS received the withdrawal notice BEFORE your approved H-1B effective start date, OGS may be able to assist you in submitting a data fix request to SEVP to return your SEVIS record to Active status if you’re otherwise eligible. Please submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form so we can review your case. If your employer did not withdraw your H-1B petition until AFTER the approved H-1B effective start date, you are not eligible to have your F-1 SEVIS record returned to Active status. You may have a 60-day grace period during which to find alternative H-1B sponsors or apply for a change of status. Advising on your options for H-1B portability, change of status, or adjustment of status is outside of the purview of OGS advisors. We recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney to discuss these options. Please review this additional information provided on the USCIS website regarding options following termination of H-1B employment. If Your Cap-Subject H-1B Petition is Denied by USCIS : Please refer to the guidance provided on the USCIS website . If an H-1B petition filed for an F-1 student with a cap-gap extension is denied, rejected, revoked, or withdrawn, the student will have the standard 60-day grace period (from the date of the notification of the denial, rejection, revocation, or withdrawal of the petition) to depart the United States. The 60-day grace period does not apply to an F-1 student whose accompanying change of status request is denied due to a status violation, misrepresentation, or fraud. In such cases, the F-1 student is ineligible for cap-gap extension of status and the 60-day grace period. Similarly, the 60-day grace period and cap-gap extension of status does not apply to an F-1 student whose petition was revoked based on a finding of a status violation, fraud or misrepresentation discovered following approval. In both of these instances, students are required to immediately leave the United States. Key Resources CAP Gap I-20 Request » This form is to request an updated I-20 showing proof of the Cap-Gap Extension if you’ve been approved for H-1B. Related Articles: International Travel STEM OPT Extension Immigration Attorneys and Pro-Bono Legal Services Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × Can OGS provide me with updates on the status of my H-1B petition? Please note: OGS is unable to provide updates to students on the status of their H-1B petitions (SEVIS updates). If questions exist regarding this matter, please refer to your immigration attorney who has completed the H-1B petition on your behalf. If you see an update to your OPT authorized dates in the SEVP Portal, this may mean there has been an update to your H-1B petition. If you notice your OPT end date has been extended to 9/30, please check with your attorney to confirm if you are subject to cap gap extension. OGS cannot confirm the status of your H-1B or provide a receipt number for your case. Can OGS provide me with a letter concerning employment eligibility or data fixes? OGS is unable to write letters to employers regarding eligibility to work or data fixes. We will be happy to forward the SEVP Policy Guidance regarding these issues. Department of Homeland Security regulations allow you to work if you are eligible for a cap gap extension of OPT, regardless of whether you have a cap gap I-20 or not. Whether your employer will allow you to work is at their discretion. What happens if my H-1B is rejected/denied/withdrawn after applying for the cap gap extension? If the student’s H-1B is not selected by the USCIS (rejected), the student will have the standard 60-day grace period* from the date of the rejection notice to depart the U.S., transfer the I-20 to a new program, or apply for a change of status. However, if a denial is based on a discovered status violation, no such grace period exists and the student must leave the U.S. immediately. If the student’s H-1B petition is selected for processing but then subsequently denied or withdrawn, the student’s OPT ends 10 days after the date of denial/withdrawal. After this, the student will have the standard 60-day grace period*, unless the denial is due to a status violation (please see above). *Students cannot work during the 60-day grace period. If my H-1B processing is delayed and I do not receive my approval by October 1, can I extend my cap gap? There is no extension for the cap gap extension of OPT. It ends on September 30, whether your H-1B is approved by then or is still pending. You will have to stop working on September 30 and wait for the H-1B approval. What are my options if my H-1B employment is terminated? Please review the information provided on the USCIS website . Advising on your options for H-1B portability, change of status, or adjustment of status is outside of the purview of OGS advisors. We recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney to discuss these options. It is important to note that, in most cases, once your status has changed to H-1B, OGS is no longer able to reactivate your F-1 SEVIS record. However, if you have an official withdrawal approval notice from USCIS confirming your H-1B petition was withdrawn by your employer prior to the H-1B effective date , OGS may be able to request that your SEVIS record be reactivated. In this case, you may contact OGS for assistance.",

The Cap – Gap Extension is an automatic extension of F-1 status that may be granted to F-1 students who need to “bridge the gap” between the expiration of their OPT/STEM EAD and the start date of their approved H-1B sponsored by a cap-subject employer. Because new H-1Bs become effective on October 1 of each year , the Cap-Gap Extension allows eligi ble F-1 students to remain in the U.S. between the expiration of their OPT/STEM Extension and the start of their H-1B. You can learn more about H-1B status and the Cap-Gap Extension here."

                "section_content": "Cap-Gap Extension Eligibility Please be aware that the responsibility of the Office of Global Services (OGS) regarding H-1B petitions is minimal. As an F-1 student, you may be eligible for the Cap-Gap extension if: You have maintained your F-1 status You are the beneficiary of an H-1B petition that was timely filed by an employer that is cap-subject The H-1B petition requests a start date of October 1st and a change of status inside the U.S. If you have applied for the H-1B via consular processing, you do not qualify for the Cap-Gap Extension. The Cap-Gap Extension is automatically applied to a student’s SEVIS record. As such OGS is able to provide proof of the extension only if a student has been deemed eligible by USCIS. If Your H-1B Petition was Filed During Your 60-Day Grace Period: If your sponsoring employer filed the H-1B petition during your 60-day grace period, your Cap-Gap Extension will allow you to remain in the U.S. until the start date of your H-1B (unless your petition is rejected, denied, or withdrawn). However, your work authorization will not be extended, and you must stop working as of the expiration date on your EAD. Please Note: Once your SEVIS record completes for the change of status to H-1B, your F-1 status has ended, and OGS is not able to “revert” your status back to F-1.

OGS DOES NOT advise students to submit an application for the STEM Extension after the expiration date of your OPT EAD, even when a student has received the Cap-Gap Extension. It is the experience of OGS and other institutions that applications for the STEM Extension have a very high rate of denial when they are submitted to USCIS beyond the OPT EAD expiration date. If a student chooses to submit an application for the STEM Extension after their Cap-Gap Extension has been applied but before their OPT EAD has expired , they are advised to also submit a letter to USCIS informing them of the date discrepancy that may exist between the actual OPT end date and the Cap Gap Extension end date (September 30). The letter should advise the adjudicators at USCIS that if the STEM Extension is approved, it must be approved based on the actual OPT end date, not based on the end date of the Cap Gap Extension. All students who request the STEM Extension after Cap-Gap has been applied to their SEVIS record will be emailed a template letter of explanation to submit to USCIS with their STEM Extension application. Students can also fill out OGS’ inquiry form to request this letter template. If a student decides to continue on their STEM extension rather than changing to H-1B, they must ensure that the employer requests the withdrawal of the H-1B petition prior to October 1. If this is not done, the H-1B status will begin on October 1 and the student’s eligibility for the STEM OPT extension will be cancelled. If a student decides to change to H-1B and not proceed with the STEM OPT extension application, the student should send a letter to the USCIS, requesting that the STEM application is withdrawn."

You seek readmission before your H-1B employment begins (normally such employment begins on October 1) You have all proper documentation including a valid passport, valid, signed Form I-20 with valid travel signature, and a valid F-1 visa. If you travel abroad before USCIS approves your H-1B change of status petition, during your cap gap extension period, USCIS will consider your change of status request abandoned and this could result in H-1B denial . If this occurs, you would not be able to re-enter the U.S. as an F-1 student pursuant to your cap gap extension, as your SEVIS record may auto-complete. Please see the USCIS page (click the “Traveling on the Cap Gap Extension” dropdown menu) for more information.

Unfortunately, in cases where students lose their H-1B employment (due to layoffs, for example) after they have already changed to H-1B, there are typically no options to reclaim unused OPT/STEM OPT time or to have their previous SEVIS record reactivated . Students should carefully consider this when applying to change to H-1B status, and be prepared that they may need to consult with an immigration attorney for next options if their H-1B employment is terminated, and that simply reverting back to F-1 status is often not possible. Students whose F-1 status has or will be changing to H-1B status, or whose H-1B employment has been withdrawn, revoked, or denied, should submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form (or H-1B Denial Notification e-form ) as soon as possible so that OGS may review your case . If your H-1B was withdrawn/revoked/denied and you have questions related to your F-1 status, please also call OGS at +1 617-373-2310 to make an appointment with an OGS advisor. If your H-1B Employer Withdraws/Revokes Your Petition : Please review the information provided on the USCIS website . If your employer can provide evidence that USCIS received the withdrawal notice BEFORE your approved H-1B effective start date, OGS may be able to assist you in submitting a data fix request to SEVP to return your SEVIS record to Active status if you’re otherwise eligible. Please submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form so we can review your case. If your employer did not withdraw your H-1B petition until AFTER the approved H-1B effective start date, you are not eligible to have your F-1 SEVIS record returned to Active status. You may have a 60-day grace period during which to find alternative H-1B sponsors or apply for a change of status. Advising on your options for H-1B portability, change of status, or adjustment of status is outside of the purview of OGS advisors. We recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney to discuss these options. Please review this additional information provided on the USCIS website regarding options following termination of H-1B employment. If Your Cap-Subject H-1B Petition is Denied by USCIS : Please refer to the guidance provided on the USCIS website . If an H-1B petition filed for an F-1 student with a cap-gap extension is denied, rejected, revoked, or withdrawn, the student will have the standard 60-day grace period (from the date of the notification of the denial, rejection, revocation, or withdrawal of the petition) to depart the United States. The 60-day grace period does not apply to an F-1 student whose accompanying change of status request is denied due to a status violation, misrepresentation, or fraud. In such cases, the F-1 student is ineligible for cap-gap extension of status and the 60-day grace period. Similarly, the 60-day grace period and cap-gap extension of status does not apply to an F-1 student whose petition was revoked based on a finding of a status violation, fraud or misrepresentation discovered following approval. In both of these instances, students are required to immediately leave the United States."

This occurs 6-months, 12-months, 18-months, and 24-months from the start date of your STEM Extension. Employment During the STEM OPT Extension It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the potential employment is related to their program of study and to report all employment to OGS via the appropriate e-form. The following criteria must be met when you engage in work during the STEM OPT Extension: You may not work part-time for any employer (20 or less hours/week). Working for more than one employer is only permitted if each job is more than 20 hours per week All work must be directly related to your program of study Self-employment is not permitted Your employer must meet the following criteria to be eligible to hire you while on the STEM OPT Extension: The employer(s) must be an E-Verify employer The employer(s) and the F-1 student must complete the Form I-983 together The employment must constitute a bona fide employer-employee relationship. The employer that signs the Form I-983 must be the same entity that employs the student and provides the practical training experience. You can read more about what constitutes an employer-employee relationship via the STEM OPT guidelines provided by USCIS. The employment must be paid. Volunteering/unpaid employment is not permitted as reportable employment during the STEM OPT Extension If you have questions about whether your employment arrangement meets STEM eligibility requirements, please consult with your employer and legal counsel ( Please refer to Study in the States for information regarding STEM eligibility requirements). 6, 12, 18, & 24-Month Validation Reporting Requirements Every six months during your STEM Extension (at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months), you are required to submit a validation report to confirm your employment information and contact information. Validation reports may be submitted as early as 3 0 days before the due date. Validations submitted to OGS by the due date are considered “timely” submitted and students should await confirmation from OGS that their validation report has been submitted to SEVP. All validations must be reported directly to OGS via the STEM Validation e-form 6-month validation report Confirm to OGS the validity of the following information: legal name, residential address, employer name and address, job title, and status of current employment 12-month validation report Confirm to OGS the validity of the following information: legal name, residential address, employer name and address, job title, and status of current employment Submit the Form I-983 with “Evaluation on Student Progress” section (top half of page 5 of the I-983) completed and signed If signing digitally, parties may sign all signature fields on the Form I-983 using electronic signatures produced with software programs or applications or use digitally reproduced copies of a signature.

Please use the “Additional Comments” section in the STEM Validation e-form to make a note of this so the assigned OGS advisor can reach out to you directly for confirmation, as the e-form will only allow reporting on one employer. Failure to Report There typically are no immediate consequences for failing to submit the validation reports. However, there are two potential consequences for missing these reporting requirements: An automatic system termination of your SEVIS record for “Failure to Report While on OPT” is possible. This decision is at the discretion of USCIS/SEVP officials. Note: OGS will NOT terminate your record due to a missed validation report USCIS/SEVP may question your failure to submit validation reports during an application for future immigration benefits (e.g. H-1B). Your attorney would be advised to assist you with these inquiries Even if you know that you missed the deadline and that your STEM Validation e-form will be denied, the OGS recommends submitting the e-form anyways as evidence that you made an effort to comply with the reporting requirements. Changing Employers During the STEM Extension You may decide to change employers while your STEM OPT Extension is pending with USCIS and/or after the STEM OPT Extension has been approved by USCIS. Anytime you decide to change employers, you must report all changes within 10-days. Changing Employers while the STEM Extension is Pending with USCIS Changing employers while your STEM OPT application is pending can cause delays and complications, so it is generally not recommended. However, if that you do need to change your employer while your application is pending, the new employer must also be enrolled in the E-Verify program and the position must meet all STEM requirements. You must report the change of employer to USCIS by doing the following: The new employer and the student must complete a new Form I-983 The student must submit the STEM Extension I-20 Request to OGS and select the option ‘ My STEM is pending and my employer has changed ’ This e-form will require you to upload the completed I-983 for your new employer as well as the I-983 for your previous employer with the “Final Evaluation on Student Progress” section completed If you applied online , s ubmit the following documents to USCIS via the myUSCIS account by uploading them under “Your Cases” > “Documents”> Unsolicited Evidence Copy of STEM OPT I-20 with new employer information (remember to sign the I-20!)

If your Post-OPT Employment Authorization Document is already expired, traveling abroad is NOT recommended. If you travel during your OPT or STEM period and your F-1 visa has expired, you will need to obtain a new F-1 visa. While on OPT/STEM, you are still considered to be an F-1 student. Expect to show similar documents as the first time you applied for your visa (check with your local US embassy for requirements). Additionally, you should have your valid STEM EAD card, I-20 with STEM recommendation on page 2 and travel signature within 6 months, passport valid within 6 months, and proof of employment. Please see Renewing your F-1 visa for further instructions on how to renew your visa. Studying during the STEM Extension While recreational or avocational study is permissible during the STEM OPT extension, students cannot pursue a degree-seeking program while simultaneously working on the STEM Extension. You should speak with a DSO in OGS to make sure your study qualifies. U.S. Federal Regulations state that employment authorization is automatically terminated when a student begins study at another education level or transfers to another school.

Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (Post-OPT) is a type of employment authorization adjudicated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It is available to eligible F-1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their program of study. A Post-OPT application first requires an OPT recommendation on a student's Form I-20, then a timely application to USCIS for final adjudication. If successful, USCIS will issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). Eligibility Students may apply for a maximum of 12-months of Post-Completion OPT upon completion of each higher degree level. Only one Post-Completion OPT application is allowed per academic degree level (i.e. Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD). You may apply for Post-Completion OPT only if all of the following criteria have been met: You have maintained a valid F-1 student status You have been enrolled full-time for at least one academic year You have completed fewer than 365 days of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT) at the degree level for which you are applying for OPT You have completed all coursework (may be in final stages of thesis/dissertation) You are inside the U.S. Note : If you depart the U.S. before your OPT application has been filed, received and receipted by the USCIS, you become ineligible to apply for Post-Completion OPT if your program has ended. Eligibility Video » Application Timeline You may apply to USCIS for Post-Completion OPT work authorization no earlier than 90 days prior to your program completion date. Post-OPT applications cannot be submitted to USCIS later than 60 days after the program completion date (i.e. during the 60-day grace period). OPT Application Timeline Important reminder about Your Program Completion Date The program end date on your I-20 is an estimated program end date, which may be different from your actual program end date. You must apply for OPT based on your last registered term. For immigration purposes, program completion date corresponds with the last term of enrollment, not necessarily the date of the graduation ceremony or degree conferral date. For example, if you finish all of your courses in May, but your degree conferral is in August, your I-20 end date will be a May date if you have no registration over the summer. PhD student Program Completion Dates Students in the PhD program may choose the date of completion based on any of the following dates: Dissertation defense date, or Dissertation/correction submission date, or End of last registered term Choosing Your Start Date If you have not used any Pre-Completion OPT time, you may request up to 12-months of Post-Completion OPT. You must request a start date within the 60-day grace period of your program. You select your own start and end date for OPT (even if you do not yet have a job offer). Here are some general suggestions to help you make the best decision for your situation: If you have a job offer and your job starts during your 60-day grace period, use the job start date (or earlier) as your requested start of OPT If you have a job offer and it starts after your 60-day grace period, use the latest date possible (59th day of grace period) for your OPT start date Reminder : Students are not eligible to begin working until the Post-OPT has been approved by USCIS, they have received their EAD, and the start date on the EAD has arrived. Application Timeline & Start Date Selection Video » Note for PhD Students If a PhD student has completed all their coursework but is in the final stages of thesis/dissertation, immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre-Completion OPT or Post-Completion OPT while completing their thesis/dissertation. In this case, the PhD student and their college need to determine the end date of program completion, and the student’s I-20 will be updated to reflect it as the completion date of the program. If you choose to apply for Post-Completion OPT while completing thesis/dissertation: You must fulfill the reporting requirements of Post-Completion OPT Days you do not have a job count toward 90 days of unemployment time You cannot request program extension even if your thesis/dissertation is not completed after Post-Completion OPT is expired Application Process (For more information, click each step below) Step 1: Log in to myOGS: Log in to Office of Global Services Post-Completion Optional Practical Training Central .

Premium Processing can be requested using the Form I-907. Students may request Premium Processing during their initial submission of the Form I-765 or may upgrade their request by applying for Premium Processing while their application is pending with USCIS. Notes from OGS Requests for premium processing must be made directly to USCIS. OGS is unable to assist students with the application process Applying for premium processing with USCIS will not impact OGS processing time OGS recognizes that not all students will have the means to request premium processing from USCIS due to its high cost. We recognize the disparity that this may cause and encourage students to submit their applications as early as possible to ensure timely adjudication by USCIS Watch the Video Mailing Your Application to USCIS (If not filing Online) USCIS recommends filing online.

The 24-month STEM OPT Extension is a type of employment authorization adjudicated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It is available to eligible F-1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their program of study. A STEM Extension application requires a student to be on an approved period of Post-Completion OPT, to have an E-verify employer that provides a student with formal training and learning, a STEM OPT recommendation on the Form I-20, then a timely application to USCIS for final adjudication. If successful, USCIS will issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) granting the student 24-months of work authorization. Eligibility All four of the below criteria must be met in order for a student to be eligible for the 24-month Optional Practical Training extension: Students who are on Post-Completion OPT; and Who have earned a bachelor’s, master’s, or PhD (certificate programs are not eligible) in a field included on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s list of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields within the last 10 years (see below for more details about how to find out if your degree is STEM designated); and Who are employed for more than 20 hours per week in a paid job directly related to his/her field of study; and Who are working for an employer that is enrolled in the U.S. Government’s E-Verify program. STEM Designated Degrees To verify STEM eligibility, look at the code listed under “Primary Major” on Page 1 of your I-20 and compare that code in the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) column of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security STEM Designated Degree Programs list. If your major code is on the list, then it is considered to be STEM eligible. You can learn more about CIP Codes and the CIP Code assignment process at Northeastern University here. Please note : the DHS STEM Designated Degree Programs list was recently updated on July 22, 2024 . Please be sure you are accessing the most recent STEM list linked above, which can also be found on the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement website on this page in the “Resources” section under the “DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List and CIP Code Nomination Process” tab. No students at Northeastern University were impacted by the update. Eligibility Video » STEM Extension Application Timeline Students may apply to USCIS for the STEM OPT Extension work authorization no earlier than 90 days prior to the Post-OPT EAD expiration date. Completed applications must be received by USCIS within 60 days of the STEM OPT recommendation date and prior to the expiration date on the Post-Completion OPT EAD to be properly (timely) filed. USCIS will not accept applications for the STEM Extension that are received beyond the expiration date of the Post-OPT EAD. COMPLETING THE FORM I-983 All students must submit a completed Form I-983 to OGS in order to receive the STEM OPT Extension recommendation on their Form I-20. Students should reference the official USCIS Instructions of the Form I-983 and the resources available on the Study in the States website as they complete the I-983. Additionally, OGS has prepared a supplemental guide to filling out the Form I-983 to assist students as they complete their application for the STEM OPT Extension. Because the STEM OPT Extension application is a personal petition to USCIS, OGS is unable to advise on how to complete each section of the form. However, this guide offers clarification on some of the I-983 instructions provided by USCIS. Please Note: All fields on the Form I-983 must be completed in full when you submit your STEM Extension request to OGS. This resource does not provide guidance on how to complete every field of every section of the I-983; rather, it has been created to help guide students through the most frequently questioned sections.

Application Process (For more information, click each step below) Step 1: Pay the STEM OPT Administrative Fee: During the STEM OPT period, there are significant reporting requirements that require extended support from the Office of Global Services. To provide continued support and service for an extended period of 24-months after graduation, including extensive tracking and reporting to SEVP, alumni who request STEM OPT Extension recommendation from OGS will be advised to pay a STEM OPT administrative fee. The payment option will be embedded in the STEM I-20 request e-form . Students will upload the payment receipt in the STEM I-20 request form as evidence of payment. Step 2: Submit the STEM Extension I-20 Request to OGS: Click here to submit the STEM OPT Extension Application e-form You must upload the following documents on the e-form: I-983 completed by you and your employer Copy of OPT EAD card Northeastern University Transcript Proof of the STEM fee payment (screenshot of confirmation page) Step 3: Prepare your STEM OPT Extension Application for USCIS: IMPORTANT: All documents must be received by USCIS within 60 days of the STEM OPT recommendation date and prior to the expiration date on your Post-Completion OPT EAD!

How F-1 Students Seeking OPT Can Avoid Form I-765 Delays Step 4: (Optional) Premium Processing In 2023, USCIS introduced the availability of Premium Processing for F-1 students submitting the Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. As of August 2024, the fee for Premium Processing is $1,685. The fee guarantees the USCIS will take adjudicative action (approval, denial, request for evidence, notice of intent to deny) on the case within 30 business days. Premium Processing can be requested using the Form I-907. Students may request Premium Processing during their initial submission of the Form I-765 or may upgrade their request by applying for Premium Processing while their application is pending with USCIS. Notes from OGS Requests for premium processing must be made directly to USCIS. OGS is unable to assist students with the application process Applying for premium processing with USCIS will not impact OGS processing time OGS recognizes that not all students will have the means to request premium processing from USCIS due to its high cost. We recognize the disparity that this may cause and encourage students to submit their applications as early as possible to ensure timely adjudication by USCIS Mailing your application to USCIS (if not applying online) USCIS recommends filing online. However, if you choose to file your application with USCIS via a mail service, please review these instructions. Guidance for Mailing a STEM OPT Extension Application to USCIS We strongly recommend that you make copies of your complete application for your records before mailing your application to USCIS. Once you have your documents and I-20 for the 24-month STEM extension, and you have copied all documentation and assembled the packet, you must send it to the USCIS address below. However, its always best practice to confirm the most up-to-date USCIS Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765 directly on the USCIS website. It is recommended that you mail your STEM packet via certified/guaranteed mail and obtain a receipt with tracking number. Mail your application to the USCIS Chicago lockbox: For U.S. Postal Service deliveries: Attn: I-765 C03 P.O. Box 805373 Chicago, IL 60680-5374 For courier service deliveries (non-U.S. Postal Service: FedEx, UPS, and DHL): USCIS Attn: I-765 C03 (Box 805373) 131 South Dearborn – 3rd Floor Chicago, IL 60603-5517 eShipGlobal Mailing Option: eShipGlobal offers a shipping service for international students sending their OPT/STEM application to USCIS. Students can choose their carrier (UPS, FedEx, or USPS) and type of delivery (next day, 2-day, etc.) and ship at discounted rates. This service is not a Northeastern service. All inquiries should be directed to eShipGlobal directly. USCIS Processing Times: USCIS advertises normal processing time for STEM OPT requests as being around 100 days. You can check current processing times on USCIS’s website After the documentation leaves the respective Lockbox, it is forwarded to the USCIS Service Center. About fifteen days after USCIS receives your application for the 24-month OPT extension, you should receive a Form I-797, a receipt notice from USCIS. What happens after I submit my application to USCIS? Remember, as long as you timely filed your application with USCIS, you may continue working for up to 180 days (6 months) while your application is pending!* Receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS and wait for adjudication You should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS. You can look up your case status online using the case number. If you file online you will receive this receipt notice electronically within a day or two. If you file by mail you should receive this notice within 2-weeks. You can check USCIS current OPT and STEM OPT estimated processing times on the USCIS website . (Select Form: “I-765” Form Category: “Based on a request by a qualified F-1 academic student [(c)(3)]” Service Center: “Potomac Service Center”.) While your STEM OPT application is pending, you may continue working for up to 180 days (6 months)* *The Code of Federal Regulations, 8CFR 214.2(f)(11)(i)(C) and 8CFR 247a.12(c)(6)(iv), automatically extend your work authorization while the application is pending. However, you must have already submitted all the appropriate documentation to USCIS and paid the filing fee prior to the expiration date of your Post-Completion OPT. Wait for your Approval Notice and Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Once USCIS adjudicates your application and your STEM OPT is approved, expect to first receive an approval notice and then an EAD Can I travel outside of the U.S. while my application with USCIS is pending? OGS advises students that they should not travel outside of the U.S. while their application with USCIS is pending. Can I change my employer while my application with USCIS is pending? Changing employers while your STEM OPT application is pending can cause delays and complications, so it is generally not recommended. However, if that you do need to change your employer while your application is pending, the new employer must also be enrolled in the E-Verify program and the position must meet all STEM requirements. Please review “Changing Employers During the STEM Extension” and select Changing Employers while the STEM Extension is Pending with USCIS for more information. Can I apply for Premium Processing while my application with USCIS is pending? F-1 students can request premium processing while their Form I-765 is Pending with USCIS. You can learn more about Premium Processing on the USCIS website. I received a Request for Evidence (RFE). What should I do next? If USCIS determines that something in your application requires further clarification they will send you a Request for Evidence (RFE). If you receive an RFE, you are required to respond by the deadline listed on the notification. You will also need to submit a copy of the RFE to OGS via the STEM OPT Issue Reporting e-form. Once you have submitted the e-form, a Designated School Official (DSO) will review your RFE and inform you of next steps. If it is determined that no evidence is needed from OGS or from your former academic department, you will receive an email with suggestions about who can provide the requested evidence. If it is determined you need documentation from OGS or your academic department, you will receive an email stating what additional documentation will be provided. RFE Review Process All RFEs are unique, therefore, all supporting letters and documents are drafted based on the specific request of the RFE. OGS may have multiple RFE being reviewed simultaneously, therefore, processing times for RFEs vary based on: The complexity of the RFE and number of required supporting documents The number of departments that are asked to provide supporting documentation The production of the PDSO Letter (the Principal Designated School Official) The due date of the RFE My STEM Extension was denied. What should I do next? Please upload the denial notice to the STEM OPT Issue Reporting e-form. A DSO will review the denial notice and advise you on next steps. My EAD has an error. What should I do next? If your Form I-765 was approved by USCIS and your EAD card contains incorrect information due to a USCIS error , you must return the original card along with a detailed explanation of the error and supporting documentation to USCIS at: USCIS Lee’s Summit Production Facility Attn: I-765 Replacement Cards 7 Product Way Lee’s Summit, MO 64002 In these cases, you do not need to submit a new Form I-765 and filing fee. The USCIS will issue a corrected EAD card within 30 days of receiving your EAD card that contains incorrect information. If you return your approved EAD card and USCIS determines your card contains incorrect information that is not due to USCIS error, the EAD will be returned to you. In this case, you will have to follow the process detailed in the Replacement Employment Authorization Document section of the Employment Authorization Document page to have your card corrected. If you do not find the information you need through online services and need further assistance, you may contact the National Customer Service Center at 1-800-375-5283 or 1-800-767-1833 Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD). https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/contact-us/national-customer-service-center Important reminders and most common application mistakes Do not submit STEM OPT application to USCIS prior to obtaining I-20 with STEM OPT recommendation USCIS must receive the STEM OPT application within 6 0 days of the STEM OPT recommendation by the OGS; if the application is not received by USCIS within 60 days after the issuance of STEM OPT recommendation, the application will be denied If your application is returned to you, submit the STEM OPT Issue Reporting e-form to receive guidance from a DSO. Your application may not be considered “received” and you may need an updated I-20 with a new STEM OPT recommendation Make sure that the address on the I-765 is valid for receiving mail at all times while your STEM OPT is pending Application Process Video » Responsibilities During the STEM OPT Extension Reporting Employment during STEM OPT It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the potential employment is related to their program of study and to timely report all employment to OGS via the appropriate e-form. You can learn more on our STEM OPT Employment Reporting page. Traveling During STEM OPT If you travel outside the U.S. or its territories during the approved STEM OPT extension period, to re-enter the country, you must present the following documents at the port of entry: A passport which should be valid for at least six months from the date you return to the U.S. and your unexpired F-1 visa stamp I-20 with a valid travel signature (While you are participating in OPT, travel signatures are valid for only 6 months) Your Employment Authorization Document card for STEM OPT extension* Proof of employment If you are not currently employed, you should not travel outside of the U.S. as you may be denied entry by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) *If your STEM OPT application is pending and you plan to travel abroad, please make sure your Post-OPT Employment Authorization Document is still valid. If your Post-OPT Employment Authorization Document is already expired, traveling abroad is NOT recommended. If you travel during your OPT or STEM period and your F-1 visa has expired, you will need to obtain a new F-1 visa. While on OPT/STEM, you are still considered to be an F-1 student. Expect to show similar documents as the first time you applied for your visa (check with your local US embassy for requirements). Additionally, you should have your valid STEM EAD card, I-20 with STEM recommendation on page 2 and travel signature within 6 months, passport valid within 6 months, and proof of employment. Please see Renewing your F-1 visa for further instructions on how to renew your visa. Studying During STEM OPT While recreational or avocational study is permissible during the STEM OPT extension, students cannot pursue a degree-seeking program while simultaneously working on the STEM Extension. You should speak with a DSO in OGS to make sure your study qualifies. U.S. Federal Regulations state that employment authorization is automatically terminated when a student begins study at another education level or transfers to another school.

Students may be eligible to apply for the STEM Extension based on a previously earned STEM degree from an accredited U.S. institution (must be within 10 years of completing the degree). For example: A student receives a bachelor’s degree in Engineering, but did not request STEM OPT employment authorization based on that degree. The student then receives an MBA and obtains authorization for 12-months of Post-OPT based on the MBA. This student may be eligible to apply for 24-month STEM OPT at the end of the 12-month Post-OPT period based on their MBA. Any students that believe they are eligible for STEM based on a previous degree should make an appointment with an OGS advisor. Can I be authorized for the STEM OPT Extension more than once? The 24-month extension of OPT is available to each student at two non-consecutive periods of time. Each STEM extension must meet the above-listed STEM eligibility requirements. Please note: This rule is different from the “standard” 12-month OPT, under which students can be approved for multiple OPT periods for each higher degree earned in the U.S. (i.e. bachelor’s, then master’s, then doctoral). What is the E-Verify program? E-Verify is a database system operated by the Department of Homeland Security in partnership with the Social Security Administration. It allows participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly-hired employees. E-Verify is currently voluntary in most states. For more information click here. Can I work while my 24-month application is pending with USCIS? Yes, a student who files a timely STEM OPT extension application can continue working while the STEM OPT application is pending, for up to 180 days beyond the expiration of the student’s standard post-completion OPT. All work done during this 180-day time period is considered STEM OPT extension time that counts towards the 24-month total. Can I change employers while my application is pending with USCIS? It should be noted that changing your employer while applying for STEM can potentially create delays in the application process.  However, if you need to change employers while your STEM application is pending with USCIS, please review the instructions in the Reporting STEM Extension OPT section. I received a Request for Evidence from USCIS. What should I do? You are required to respond to the RFE by the deadline specified on the letter. If you can prepare the document(s) they ask for, you may respond on your own. If you are unsure of how to handle the RFE, please complete the STEM OPT Issue Reporting e-form and upload a copy of the RFE. Can I apply for STEM OPT extension if I have a pending H-1B application? Yes, you may apply for the 24 month OPT STEM extension while you are also in your period of Cap Gap extension. If you choose to continue on your 24 month extension rather than change to H-1B, you must ensure your employer requests the withdrawal of your H- 1B petition prior to October 1. If this is not done, your H-1B status will begin on October 1, and your eligibility for the 24 month STEM extension will be cancelled. If you choose to change to H-1B and not proceed with your 24 month STEM extension application, you should send a letter to the USCIS service center reviewing your application and request that your STEM application is withdrawn.  Your letter should include your name, SEVIS ID, receipt number, reason for withdrawal, and your signature (in ink). What happens if my EAD card has incorrect information on it? If your Form I-765 was approved by USCIS and your EAD card contains incorrect information due to a USCIS error , you must return the original card along with a detailed explanation of the error and supporting documentation to USCIS at: USCIS Lee’s Summit Production Facility Attn: I-765 Replacement Cards 7 Product Way Lee’s Summit, MO 64002 In these cases, you do not need to submit a new Form I-765 and filing fee. The USCIS will issue a corrected EAD card within 30 days of receiving your EAD card that contains incorrect information. If you return your approved EAD card and USCIS determines your card contains incorrect information that is not due to USCIS error, the EAD will be returned to you. In this case, you will have to follow the process detailed in the Replacement Employment Authorization Document section of the Employment Authorization Document page to have your card corrected.

How F-1 Students Seeking OPT Can Avoid Form I-765 Delays Step 4: (Optional) Premium Processing In 2023, USCIS introduced the availability of Premium Processing for F-1 students submitting the Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. As of August 2024, the fee for Premium Processing is $1,685. The fee guarantees the USCIS will take adjudicative action (approval, denial, request for evidence, notice of intent to deny) on the case within 30 business days. Premium Processing can be requested using the Form I-907. Students may request Premium Processing during their initial submission of the Form I-765 or may upgrade their request by applying for Premium Processing while their application is pending with USCIS. Notes from OGS Requests for premium processing must be made directly to USCIS. OGS is unable to assist students with the application process Applying for premium processing with USCIS will not impact OGS processing time OGS recognizes that not all students will have the means to request premium processing from USCIS due to its high cost. We recognize the disparity that this may cause and encourage students to submit their applications as early as possible to ensure timely adjudication by USCIS"

Once you have your documents and I-20 for the 24-month STEM extension, and you have copied all documentation and assembled the packet, you must send it to the USCIS address below. However, its always best practice to confirm the most up-to-date USCIS Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765 directly on the USCIS website. It is recommended that you mail your STEM packet via certified/guaranteed mail and obtain a receipt with tracking number. Mail your application to the USCIS Chicago lockbox: For U.S. Postal Service deliveries: Attn: I-765 C03 P.O.

Students can choose their carrier (UPS, FedEx, or USPS) and type of delivery (next day, 2-day, etc.) and ship at discounted rates. This service is not a Northeastern service. All inquiries should be directed to eShipGlobal directly. USCIS Processing Times: USCIS advertises normal processing time for STEM OPT requests as being around 100 days. You can check current processing times on USCIS’s website After the documentation leaves the respective Lockbox, it is forwarded to the USCIS Service Center.

OGS advises students that they should not travel outside of the U.S. while their application with USCIS is pending. Can I change my employer while my application with USCIS is pending? Changing employers while your STEM OPT application is pending can cause delays and complications, so it is generally not recommended. However, if that you do need to change your employer while your application is pending, the new employer must also be enrolled in the E-Verify program and the position must meet all STEM requirements.

You can learn more about Premium Processing on the USCIS website. I received a Request for Evidence (RFE). What should I do next? If USCIS determines that something in your application requires further clarification they will send you a Request for Evidence (RFE). If you receive an RFE, you are required to respond by the deadline listed on the notification. You will also need to submit a copy of the RFE to OGS via the STEM OPT Issue Reporting e-form. Once you have submitted the e-form, a Designated School Official (DSO) will review your RFE and inform you of next steps. If it is determined that no evidence is needed from OGS or from your former academic department, you will receive an email with suggestions about who can provide the requested evidence. If it is determined you need documentation from OGS or your academic department, you will receive an email stating what additional documentation will be provided. RFE Review Process All RFEs are unique, therefore, all supporting letters and documents are drafted based on the specific request of the RFE. OGS may have multiple RFE being reviewed simultaneously, therefore, processing times for RFEs vary based on: The complexity of the RFE and number of required supporting documents The number of departments that are asked to provide supporting documentation The production of the PDSO Letter (the Principal Designated School Official) The due date of the RFE My STEM Extension was denied. What should I do next? Please upload the denial notice to the STEM OPT Issue Reporting e-form. A DSO will review the denial notice and advise you on next steps. My EAD has an error. What should I do next? If your Form I-765 was approved by USCIS and your EAD card contains incorrect information due to a USCIS error , you must return the original card along with a detailed explanation of the error and supporting documentation to USCIS at: USCIS Lee’s Summit Production Facility Attn: I-765 Replacement Cards 7 Product Way Lee’s Summit, MO 64002 In these cases, you do not need to submit a new Form I-765 and filing fee. The USCIS will issue a corrected EAD card within 30 days of receiving your EAD card that contains incorrect information. If you return your approved EAD card and USCIS determines your card contains incorrect information that is not due to USCIS error, the EAD will be returned to you. In this case, you will have to follow the process detailed in the Replacement Employment Authorization Document section of the Employment Authorization Document page to have your card corrected.

If your Post-OPT Employment Authorization Document is already expired, traveling abroad is NOT recommended. If you travel during your OPT or STEM period and your F-1 visa has expired, you will need to obtain a new F-1 visa. While on OPT/STEM, you are still considered to be an F-1 student. Expect to show similar documents as the first time you applied for your visa (check with your local US embassy for requirements). Additionally, you should have your valid STEM EAD card, I-20 with STEM recommendation on page 2 and travel signature within 6 months, passport valid within 6 months, and proof of employment. Please see Renewing your F-1 visa for further instructions on how to renew your visa. Studying During STEM OPT While recreational or avocational study is permissible during the STEM OPT extension, students cannot pursue a degree-seeking program while simultaneously working on the STEM Extension. You should speak with a DSO in OGS to make sure your study qualifies. U.S. Federal Regulations state that employment authorization is automatically terminated when a student begins study at another education level or transfers to another school."

Academic Training Explained Academic Training (AT) is an employment authorization granted to eligible J-1 Students. It is designed to complement their programs of study in the United States. AT is authorized by the program sponsor Students may engage in AT during their academic program and/or after the completion of their studies AT can be paid or unpaid, but must be authorized regardless of compensation The work must be directly related to the student’s field of study The work must be commensurate with their level of education The work must be in a fully in-person or hybrid position (with no more than 40% remote) The total amount of AT cannot exceed the total length of the academic program AT authorization is location and date specific. The employer’s name and address and the employment dates must be authorized in advance by an Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) in the Office of Global Services (OGS). Pre-Completion vs. Post-Completion Academic Training Pre-completion AT takes place before the J-1 student completes all of their degree requirements. Post-Completion AT takes place after the J-1 student has completed all degree requirements. Eligibility Requirements A J-1 student is eligible for Academic Training if they meet the following requirements: Student has maintained valid J-1 status throughout their program Student is in good academic standing or has successfully completed program of study Student is proposing a training experience that is directly related to their field of study and has been approved by the academic advisor or Co-op coordinator Student will not engage in a 100% remote academic training opportunity. Students may work remotely no more than 40% of the time (e.g., two days out of five in a standard work week ) when their employers have instituted partial remote policies. Please see the June 2023 Department of State guidance directive for more information. Student is maintaining health insurance coverage for themselves and any J-2 dependents Time Limitations J-1 Undergraduate and Master’s Degree students are eligible for up to 18 months of AT; this includes both pre- and post-completion AT (pre-AT & post-AT) NOTE: through June 30, 2026, the Department of State is allowing extension up to 36 months (or length of degree program, whichever is shorter) for undergraduate and master’s degree level students in eligible STEM fields . Please contact OGS for more information You may notice that your major as listed on the DS-2019 form may differ from your academic program name. This is not an error. Please note that this reflects the official Classification of Instructional Programs ( CIP ) code and name for your program as Northeastern reports to the Department of Education. You can learn more about CIP Codes and the CIP Code assignment process at Northeastern University here . J-1 Doctoral Degree students are eligible for up to 36 months of AT; this includes both Pre- and Post-AT. J-1 Non-Degree Exchange Students are eligible for AT equivalent to their program duration, not to exceed a total program duration of 24 months. The total AT period may not exceed the amount of time spent in a full course of study Example: A Master’s student who completed their program in 12 months is only eligible for 12 months of AT Example: A Non-Degree Exchange student in a 9-Month Academic Year exchange program at Northeastern would be eligible for no more than 9 Months of post-AT. A Non-Degree Exchange Student in a one-semester, 4-Month program, would be eligible for no more than 4 Months of post-AT. Post-AT time begins the day after the program end date listed on your DS-2019, whether you are working or not. Example: If your graduation date is 5/8/2019, you must start counting your post-AT time on 5/9/2019, even if you do not start working on that date It is your responsibility to track your AT usage Post-AT authorization must be processed before the graduation date on your DS-2019 Post-AT must begin within 30 days completion of your studies. Please note: Both full and part-time AT deduct at a full-time rate. This means that, even if AT authorization is given for work done on a part-time basis, each day of part-time training deducts a full day from the total amount of time a student is eligible for AT. Requesting Authorization To participate in an off-campus experiential learning opportunity in the U.S., J-1 Students must obtain AT authorization from OGS. All students must comply with their college's requirements and policies concerning the timing of eligibility for Co-op or other experiential learning opportunity. Please note that individual academic departments or colleges may have additional requirements and regulations for eligibility. OGS will not review any requests for AT that have not already been reviewed by the appropriate advisor. 1 Meet with your academic or Co-op advisor to discuss your experiential learning opportunity. OGS will not review any requests that have not been approved by your academic or Co-op advisor. 2 Complete the Academic Training Authorization Request with your academic or Co-op advisor. The Academic Training Authorization Request Form can be found on the Office of Global Services website. 3 Upload the appropriate completed e-form with your advisor signature at the link provided on the first page of instructions.

If denied, the student will need to resubmit the e-form after making appropriate adjustments to their application. Authorized students will receive an email to their Northeastern University email address with their digitally-signed DS-2019 and AT authorization letter for Social Security Number eligibility attached. PLEASE NOTE : approval from your academic or co-op advisor for an off-campus internship/co-op does NOT mean you are automatically authorized to work off-campus. You should not engage in any off-campus employment until you receive an authorization from OGS. Important Post-Completion Academic Training Reminders Post-completion AT applications must be submitted at least 15 business days before your completion of studies (DS-2019 program end date). After this date, the SEVIS record will become inactive and OGS will be unable to authorize AT. Post-completion AT employment must begin within 30 days of your completion of studies (DS-2019 program end date). Example: If a student’s graduation date is 5/8/2024, work on post-completion AT would need to start by 6/7/2024. You must maintain health insurance that meets the J-1 requirements for the entire duration of your academic training period. Reviewing Your Updated DS-2019 When you receive your updated, digitally-signed DS-2019 with an academic training authorization on Page 1, it is very important that you read your DS-2019 carefully to make sure you understand the limitations of your authorization . This will enable you to maintain your status while on AT and avoid working outside of your authorization. Please pay specific attention to the following areas: Box 3 Form Covers Period – here you can see your new end date (if on post-completion AT) Box 5 Academic Training – here you can see your employer information as well as the dates you are authorized to work If there are any issues or concerns, please notify an Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) in OGS. Maintaining Status while on AT Update OGS of any changes to your training. AT Authorization is employer, location, and date specific. Depending on the change, OGS may request additional documentation. It is important you do not engage in any changes until you have received your updated DS-2019 from OGS. NOTE: OGS will not update your AT unless you have approval from the original advisor who signed off on your Academic Training Authorization Request. You must maintain health insurance that meets the J-1 requirements for the entire duration of your academic training period. 100% remote work during academic training is not permitted per Department of State guidance . Students may work remotely no more than 40% of the time (e.g., two days out of five in a standard work week ) when their employers have instituted partial remote policies. IMPORTANT REMINDER REGARDING AT EXTENSIONS: If you are seeking an extension of your AT authorization, you may not request an extension via the update e-form. If you are extending your AT, you must submit the Academic Training Authorization Request. For all other changes to an AT, please submit the AT Updates Request . AT Evaluation Requirement Per Department of State federal regulation 2 CFR 62.23(f)(6), Northeastern University as your J-1 program sponsor “…must evaluate the effectiveness and appropriateness of the academic training in achieving the stated goals and objectives in order to ensure the quality of the academic training program.” All J-1 students on Academic Training must submit an Academic Training (AT) Evaluation e-form at the following times: When changing AT employers, you must submit an AT evaluation for the employer you are leaving. PLEASE NOTE: you must also submit an AT Updates e-form if changing employers. At the end of your AT period Key Resources Academic Training (AT) Authorization Request Form » This e-form is to request authorization to apply for AT. Academic Training (AT) Update Request Form » This e-form is to request an update to your AT authorization. Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × When do I need authorization? This question is based off of what the U.S. government considers to be employment. Employment is considered work for compensation. Compensation can be monetary, but it can also be food, travel, lodging, or even beneficial experience. If you are benefiting from your participation in any way, you require authorization. IMPORTANT: Just because an opportunity is unpaid does not mean it does not require authorization. Do I need a valid visa to apply for Academic Training? No. Visas are for entry purposes only. OGS does not require your visa to authorize AT. How do I calculate how much money I will need for Post-Academic Training time? Students are required to show a minimum of $2,334 per month when requesting or extending AT. In cases which require students to prorate how much money they need to show, the following breakdown may be helpful: Per month – $2,334 Per week – $584 Per day – $84 What kind of financial documents can I submit if I'm applying for Post-Academic Training? Financial documentation must meet the following criteria: Be in English or a verified English translation Show name of account holder. If the account holder is not the student, the account holder must submit a signed statement taking financial responsibility for the student. Be issued within the past nine months Be liquid (see below for examples of acceptable vs. unacceptable funds) Acceptable forms of liquid funding: Checking or savings account Money market account Certificates/term/fixed deposits (with maturity dates no later than the program start date) Educational loans (a loan application is not sufficient) Benevolent account Current account Post office account Job offer letter Unacceptable forms of funding: Investment portfolios (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) Retirement plans Public Provident funds Available lines of credit Wire transfers Deeds to real estate Leases with rental income Salary agreements or pay stubs Material items (livestock, land, jewelry, fur) Income tax forms",

Overview Optional Practical Training (OPT) is an employment authorization benefit for F-1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their major field of study . It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the accepted employment is related to his/her program of study. Students may engage in Pre-Completion OPT (or Pre-OPT) while actively enrolled in an academic program. To request Pre-OPT work authorization, students must: Request an I-20 with a recommendation for Pre-OPT from OGS Submit an application to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for review and adjudication Students are eligible for a total of 12-months of Optional Practical Training (OPT) at each degree level. This means that any time for which a student receives Pre-OPT authorization will be subtracted from the time available for Post-Completion OPT. Note: Pre-OPT work authorization is only available to students when they are actively enrolled at Northeastern. In order to request work authorization post-graduation, students must submit an application for Post-Completion OPT. Eligibility A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree student may be eligible to apply for Pre-OPT prior to completion of studies both during the academic year and during the annual vacation period. PhD students may be eligible to apply for Pre-OPT any time during the program of study if all course work other than the thesis/dissertation has been completed. To apply for Pre-OPT, all of the following criteria must be met: You must be maintaining lawful F-1 student status You have studied as a full-time degree-seeking student in the U.S. for at least 1 academic year at an SEVP authorized school Time spent in language training and non-degree programs does not count toward the one academic year requirement You have not exceeded 364 days of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT) at the current degree level You have not previously engaged in 12 months of full-time Pre- or Post-OPT at your current degree level You have registered for a full-time course load with appropriate on-ground presence during the entire period of requested Pre-OPT This does not apply if the requested Pre-OPT will take place during the annual vacation period Full-time vs. Part-time Pre-OPT A student may be eligible to apply for part-time (less than 20 hours per week) or full-time (more than 20 hours per week) Pre-OPT. Please see below for eligibility requirements for both options: Part-Time Pre-OPT (20 or less hours/week): During an academic term During annual vacation and other official school breaks Full-Time Pre-OPT (more than 20 hours/week): During annual vacation and other official school breaks For PhD students who have completed all coursework except thesis/dissertation NOTE: full-time pre-OPT is NOT allowed during required academic terms except for certain PhD students as mentioned in the bullet above Special Considerations for PhD students If a PhD student has completed all coursework but is in the final stages of thesis/dissertation, immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre-Completion OPT or Post-Completion OPT while completing the thesis/dissertation. In this case, the PhD student and his/her college need to determine the program completion date, which will be reflected on the I-20. If you choose to apply for Post-Completion OPT while completing your thesis/dissertation: You must fulfill the reporting requirements of Post-OPT The days you do not have a job count towards your 90 days of unemployment time You cannot request a program extension even if your thesis/dissertation is not completed after Post-OPT is expired Note : If you are a student with Stipended Graduate Assistantship (SGA), you must discuss with your department to determine when your SGA will end. The SGA cannot extend beyond the end date as listed on your I-20.

However, if you choose to file your application with USCIS via a mail service, please review these instructions. Guidance for Mailing a Pre-OPT Application to USCIS We strongly recommend that you make copies of your complete application for your records before mailing your application to USCIS. Once you have assembled your Pre-OPT I-20 and all other required documents into a packet, you must send it to the USCIS address below. However, it is always best practice to confirm the most up to date USCIS Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765 directly on the USCIS website. It is recommended you mail your OPT packet through certified mail which includes a tracking number and guaranteed delivery date. Effective 01/08/2021, you will mail your application to the USCIS Chicago lockbox: For U.S. Postal Service deliveries: Attn: I-765 C03 P.O. Box 805373 Chicago, IL 60680-5374 For courier service deliveries (non-U.S. Postal Service: FedEx, UPS, and DHL): USCIS Attn: I-765 C03 (Box 805373) 131 South Dearborn – 3rd Floor Chicago, IL 60603-5517 eShipGlobal Mailing Option eShipGlobal offers a shipping service for international students sending their OPT applications to USCIS. Students can choose their carrier (UPS, FedEx, or USPS) and type of delivery (next day, 2-day, etc.) and ship at discounted rates. This service is not a Northeastern University service. All inquiries should be directed to eShipGlobal directly. USCIS Processing Times USCIS advertises normal processing time for OPT requests as being around 100 days. You can check current processing times on USCIS’s website After the documentation leaves the respective Lockbox, it is forwarded to the USCIS Service Center. About fifteen days after USCIS receives your application for Pre-OPT, you should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS. What Happens After I Submit my Application to USCIS? You should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS. You can look up your case status online using the case number. If you file online you will receive this receipt notice electronically within a day or two. If you file by mail you should receive this notice within 2-weeks. If you submitted the G1145 form with your application, you will be informed electronically by email and/or text If you paid for your Pre-OPT fee by personal check, the back of the cashed check will have the number. You may obtain a copy of this check from your bank . You may contact the USCIS call center at 800-375-5283. Once USCIS adjudicates your application and your Pre-OPT is approved, expect to first receive an approval notice and then an EAD. You must not work until you receive your EAD card and you may only work within the dates specified on the EAD card. The EAD card, not your approval notice, is your work authorization documentation. Note : Your application will remain in “pending” status until a decision has been made on your application (this may be a few months). Adjudication of your application is completed by USCIS. Therefore, USCIS will inform you directly of the official receipt, request for additional information, and the decision on your application. Please be aware that this is a normal processing timeframe, and regrettably, OGS is unable to assist in expediting any requests. OGS is here to guide you if you receive any communication from USCIS that requires response (request for additional information, denial, etc.). Unemployment During Pre-OPT There are no restrictions on unemployment during Pre-OPT. Students are not required to have a job offer to apply for Pre-Completion OPT; however, it is advantageous to have prospective employment opportunities since any time authorized for Pre-OPT is subtracted from the time available for Post-OPT, whether the student obtains employment or not. Important Reminders USCIS must receive the Pre-OPT application within 30 days of the issued OPT recommendation by OGS; if the application is not received by USCIS within 30 days after the issuance of the OPT I-20, the application will be denied ( t his is the most common reason for the denial of Pre-OPT ) If your entire application is returned to you, consult with an OGS Advisor before resubmitting the application; your application may not be considered “received” and you may need a new I-20 with OPT recommendation Do not submit a Pre-OPT application to USCIS prior to obtaining an I-20 with the OPT recommendation Make sure that the address on your OPT application is valid for receiving mail at all times during OPT processing If you have a pending Pre-OPT application and are simultaneously applying for Post-OPT , OGS will not issue a Post-Completion OPT Recommendation I-20 until: Your Pre-Completion OPT application has been approved by USCIS and you have received your EAD, or OGS receives confirmation that your application has been withdrawn by USCIS (or was never submitted to USCIS). Travel While on Pre-OPT During Pre-OPT, travel restrictions remain the same as they are during normal F-1 study. You should carry the following documents when re-entering the U.S.: A passport which should be valid for at least six months from the date you return to the U.S. Unexpired F-1 visa I-20 with a valid travel signature (travel signatures are valid for 1 year) You can review more information about traveling internationally here.

You are required to respond to the Request for Evidence by the deadline specified on the letter. If you can prepare the document(s) they ask for, you may respond on your own. If you have any questions, you may make an appointment with an OGS advisor. How do I change my address while my Pre-Completion OPT application is pending? While your application is still pending with the USCIS, follow the instructions below to update your mailing address: https://egov.uscis.gov/coa/displayCOAForm.do If you are moving and not just updating the address to which your EAD card should be mailed, then you must also update your address on your myNortheastern account. How do I withdraw my Pre-OPT application? If your application is still pending with the USCIS, and you decide not to pursue Pre-Completion OPT, you may withdraw your application. In this case, you will need to mail a letter to request withdrawal of your application to the USCIS address that is listed on your receipt notice, and a copy of your receipt notice. The letter should include the following elements: Note “Re: I-765 Withdrawal” on the letter Include biographical information to identify the student, including name, date of birth, and SEVIS Identification number Reference the receipt number for the I-765 application (from the Form I-797 receipt notice); a copy of the receipt notice can also be helpful Specific request that the Form I-765 application for Pre-Completion OPT be withdrawn Student’s signature Once your application is withdrawn, you should receive the withdrawal acknowledgement letter from USCIS. If you do not receive anything within 1 month, please contact OGS. What happens if my EAD card has incorrect information on it? If your EAD card was processed by the Potomac Service Center: If your Form I-765 was approved by the Potomac Service Center and your EAD contains incorrect information due to the USCIS error, you must return the original card along with a detailed explanation of the error and supporting documentation to the Potomac Service Center at: Potomac Service Center USCIS 2200 Potomac Center Drive, Stop 2425 Arlington, VA 20598-2425 In these cases, you do not need to submit a new Form I-765 and filing fee. The Potomac Service Center will issue a corrected EAD within 30 days of receiving your EAD that contains incorrect information due to the USCIS error. If you return your Potomac Service Center-approved EAD card and the Potomac Service Center determines that your card contains incorrect information that is not due to the USCIS error, the Potomac Service Center will return the EAD card to you. In this case, you will have to follow the process detailed in the Replacement EAD section of the Employment Authorization Document page on order to have your card corrected. If you do not find the information you need through our online services and need further assistance, you may contact our National Customer Service Center at 1-800-375-5283 or 1-800-767-1833 Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD). If your EAD card was processed by a Service Center other than Potomac, call the USCIS customer service at 1-800-375-5283 or 1-800-767-1833 and ask for instructions. https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/contact-us/national-customer-service-center I did not get my EAD card in the mail after receiving the approval notice. What do I do? Find your tracking number of your mail from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services case status , contact the U.S. Postal Service to see if they can locate your EAD card if it already says “delivered” status. If your card is not received within 2-3 weeks of receiving your approval notice or seeing that your case status shows your card was “delivered,” then you can make an e-request through the USCIS. Please note: This e-request may result in a response from the USCIS or it may result in the production of an EAD card; a new card is estimated to take approximately 120 days. For questions about this e-request through the USCIS, please contact the USCIS Customer Service at: 1-800-375-5283 or 1-800-767-1833 If it is determined that your EAD is lost in the mail and you do not want to wait for a response from the USCIS, you will have to apply for a replacement of EAD by submitting the following documents to the lockbox, as you did for your initial application. Processing times will be the same as processing times for the initial OPT approval. Letter explaining what happened to previously issued card (include police report if applicable) I-765 (check the box that indicates that you are applying for a “Replacement” card) G-1145 $410 check, money order or bank check made payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Copies of previous I-20s Copy of F-1 visa Copy of passport Passport photos Approval Notice of Optional Practical Training/Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) I do not have a Social Security Number. When can I apply for one? You may apply for a Social Security Number when you apply for your Pre-Completion OPT. When filling out the I-765, Field 14 Do you want the SSA to issue you a Social Security card? – Check “Yes” and you will receive a SSN with your Pre-Completion OPT. How many days of unemployment can I have during Pre-Completion OPT? There are no restrictions of unemployment during Pre-Completion OPT. Students are not required to have a job offer to apply for Pre-Completion OPT; however, it is usually advantageous to at least have prospective employment opportunities since any time authorized for Pre-Completion OPT is subtracted from the time available for Post-Completion OPT, whether the student obtains employment or not. I applied for Pre-Completion OPT. My application is still pending, but now I want to apply for Post-Completion OPT; what do I do? If you have a pending Pre-OPT application and you would like to apply for Post-OPT, then you will need to deduct the entire requested Pre-Completion OPT period from your 12 months of Post-Completion OPT. If your Pre-Completion OPT has been approved, the entire approved period will be deducted from your 12 months of Post-Completion OPT. Part-time Pre-Completion OPT is deducted at half the rate from your Post-Completion OPT. For example, if you are approved for 4 months of part-time Pre-Completion OPT, then 2 months will be deducted from your 12 months of Post-Completion OPT. I am doing Pre-OPT and want to do Post-Completion OPT right after. Do I have to apply twice or can I apply for both at the same time? Pre-Completion OPT and Post-Completion OPT applications have to be done separately. If you are planning to do both Pre-Completion OPT and Post-Completion OPT, you will have to apply to the USCIS twice (and pay an application fee each time). It is my last semester and I only have one class to take – can I work full-time on Pre-Completion OPT? During your last semester, even if you are under-enrolled, you are still taking required course(s), so you can only engage in part-time Pre-Completion OPT (20 hours per week or less). Can I work on-campus while I am on Pre-Completion OPT? Students on Pre-Completion OPT can work on-campus in addition to working on Pre-Completion OPT. Students cannot engage in a Stipended Graduate Assistantship position while on Pre-Completion OPT.",

There are specific requirements and restrictions for on-campus employment, however, so please be sure to carefully review this page before engaging in on-campus employment. Overview and Definition F-1 students enrolled in degree-seeking programs and J-1 degree-seeking and exchange students at Northeastern University are eligible to work on-campus while attending classes. The work does not need to be related to the student’s field of study. Students must maintain legal F-1 or J-1 status while engaging in on-campus employment. On-campus employment includes: Working for Northeastern University in the library, laboratories, residential buildings, administrative offices, or doing research on-campus Employment with Northeastern based on a fellowship, assistantship, or grant (such as a teaching or research assistantship) Employment with approved on-location commercial firms which provide services for students on campus, such as restaurants located in a University-owned building If you have questions about if something counts as “on-campus” please review the list of eligible on-campus employers below or reach out to OGS directly. NOTE: J-1 students whose J-1 program sponsor is Fulbright or another organization other than Northeastern will need to request on-campus work permission (and any necessary authorization letters to apply for an SSN) from their J-1 program sponsor. Policies Students may work up to 20 hours/week during required academic terms and more than 20 hours/week during non-required academic terms and official school breaks as long as they are planning to enroll full-time the next academic term (this does not include recesses or days with no class) If you are in your final academic term you may not work more than 20 hours/week If full time enrollment is required for you during the summer term(s), you may not work more than 20 hours/week.

The dates of the finals period are posted in the Academic Calendar Students may be eligible to work on-campus while also engaging in Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Pre-Completion Academic Training (AT) if allowed by their department Students holding a Stipended Graduate Assistantship (SGA) should review this page for eligibility/requirements and submit the appropriate request for that type of on-campus employment. Students engaging in an SGA may not work in additional on-campus jobs Remote on-campus employment : F-1 students can participate in remote on-campus employment for a different Northeastern campus located in the U.S. that is not their home campus. F-1 students are not eligible to work remotely for a non-U.S. based Northeastern campus. Example: An F-1 student at the Boston campus may be a Teaching Assistant for a course taking place at the Seattle campus. However, an F-1 student at the Silicon Valley campus cannot be a Teaching Assistant for a course taking place at the Toronto, Canada campus or other non-U.S. campus.

Understanding Curricular Practical Training (CPT) CPT is a form of curricular training authorization available for eligible F-1 students during their program of study for experiential learning opportunities that are necessary and integral, or required, as part of an academic program at Northeastern University. CPT authorization must be obtained for every co-op, internship, practicum, clinical rotation, corporate residency, experiential PhD, or other approved experiential learning opportunity CPT authorization is required prior to the intended start date of the experiential learning , whether or not the activity takes place on-campus or off-campus CPT can be either full-time (more than 20 hours per week) or part-time (20 hours or less per week) CPT can be either paid or unpaid CPT is employer, location, full-time/part-time, and date specific. The employer’s name, address and the precise start and end dates must be authorized by OGS in advance Students must maintain on-ground presence during every required term of study. This includes any required term when a student is authorized for CPT Once authorized for CPT, F-1 students must comply with the authorization granted. Any extensions, cancellations, or changes to authorized CPT must be first approved by the academic advisor/co-op coordinator and OGS. Non-curricular based on-campus activities (commonly referred to as “on-campus employment”) do not require CPT authorization. If you have any questions about how this applies to you, please contact OGS. If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff/faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern, please review this guidance from Northeastern’s University Office of General Counsel. Eligibility Requirements In order to be eligible for CPT, students must meet all of the following requirements Comply with all college academic and enrollment eligibility requirements and policies for experiential learning This includes every co-op, internship, practicum, clinical rotation, corporate residency, experiential PhD, or other experiential learning opportunity, whether the activity takes place on-campus or off-campus Enroll in a course that requires an experiential learning component in the syllabus. This will usually be a Co-op course or another program-required course Enrollment must be maintained for the entire period of authorized CPT Complete at least one academic year as a full-time, degree-seeking student with an active SEVIS record* One academic year is defined as two semesters or three quarters while maintaining on-ground presence Time spent in Prematriculation and Pathway programs (including N.U.in, Foundation Year, NU Immerse, Global Scholars, and Global Pathways) will not accrue time toward CPT eligibility. Students enrolled in such programs will only begin to accrue time toward CPT eligibility once they have fully matriculated into a degree-seeking program *Limited exceptions to the completion of one academic year may apply in the following circumstances: For students in graduate-level programs that require immediate participation in experiential learning for program completion For students who completed one academic year in another visa status or institution changed to F-1 status within the U.S. or by travel and re-entry, who otherwise qualify Change of Status and SEVIS Transfer Students please review “Change of Status and Transfer Students” below for more information Maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence during every required term of study Review the OGS Guidelines on Maintaining Status for more information A huge part of your responsibility of maintaining your F-1 status is by actively participating in your academic activities in person. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term. As an international student, this prolonged absence may impact your F-1 status and your long-term academic goals as well as future immigration benefits. Make normal progress towards degree completion CPT authorization must not cause a delay in the completion of a student’s academic program Maintaining On-Ground Presence when Authorized for CPT F-1 international students must maintain on-ground presence during every required academic term of study to maintain nonimmigrant student status . This includes any required term when a student is engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization. Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during non-required terms. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In person (Traditional): All engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Hybrid: The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Remote (Online): The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer’s physical location Full-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization To maintain on-ground presence during a required term while pursuing full-time experiential learning, students have the following options: Option 1 : Engaging on-site (in person) at the employer’s physical location. This can be in-person or hybrid, as defined above Students will be maintaining on-ground presence based on their engagement with the employer Option 2 : Engaging remotely with the employer with simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course Students should enroll in an on-ground course stipulated by their academic program, which must run for the duration of the required academic term. Students should work with their academic department/advisor/co-op advisor to identify a course that is appropriate. Co-op students only : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements. If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor. Part-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization F-1 Students engaged remotely in part-time practical training/experiential learning must couple their part-time practical experience course enrollment with only on-ground courses to meet both the on-ground requirement and the full-time status requirement. As such, students engaging in part-time co-ops are not eligible to maintain their on-ground presence through the EXED course and may not enroll in online classes to meet the minimum credit requirements for the term. Experiential Learning with an Overseas Employer with CPT Authorization F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain their on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above. Failure to Maintain On-Ground Presence If an F-1 student withdraws from or fails to attend their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training, it will be considered a violation of status and the student’s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated. Regardless of the modality of the practical experience, students need regular engagement with both the practical training provider as well as the academic program to confirm successful progression of the practical training experience. Travel during Experiential Learning Engaging on-site at your employer’s physical location or participating in a university designated on-ground course is a mandatory to maintain the on-ground presence required by your F-1 student status. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term, as their F-1 status and academic goals may be negatively impacted. In cases where travel outside of the U.S. cannot be avoided, we highly recommend that students limit their absence from the U.S. and in-person classes as much as possible. If students choose to travel during a required term, they are taking on the associated risks, including but not limited to scrutiny by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) upon re-entry to the U.S. as well as scrutiny when applying for future immigration status or benefits. Application Process To participate in an experiential learning opportunity in the U.S., F-1 students must obtain CPT authorization from OGS. All CPT requests must first be academically reviewed, approved, and determined to be integral or required for degree completion, by the appropriate advisor, co-op coordinator, or authorized secondary approver. Step 1: Student completes the CPT Authorization Request e-form The student must fill out the CPT Authorization Request e-form. The documents the student will need include: Electronic I-94 (“Class of Admission” must be F-1 and “Admit Until Date” must indicate “D/S”) Passport identity page that is valid at least until the start date of the CPT authorization When the student has submitted the e-form it will be routed to the secondary approver as indicated in the e-form. Step 2: Secondary approver reviews student's CPT e-form submission The Authorized Secondary Approver (CPT) who receives the request will review the information the student has entered and determine if they approve it academically as either integral or required for program completion. If approved, the Authorized Secondary Approver will submit the request to OGS. If the Authorized Secondary Approver does not approve of the request, they will email the student directly regarding their decision. See below for Authorized Secondary Approver Lists : Undergraduate Students Graduate Students Step 3: OGS reviews completed CPT e-form submission Upon receipt of the completed e-form from the Secondary Approver, OGS will review the CPT request within 15 business days. OGS will examine the student’s documents to determine if they meet all F-1 eligibility requirements for CPT. OGS may place the request on hold and email the student/advisor for more information or approve/deny the CPT request. Step 4: Student receives updated I-20 with CPT recommendation If your CPT request is approved, a Designated School Official (DSO) from OGS will send the I-20 electronically to your Northeastern University email. You are advised to: Review your I-20 to ensure all information is accurate and complete Print and sign your I-20 Only work within the listed start and end dates on your I-20 Updating or changing your CPT authorization While on CPT, any updates, extensions, changes, or cancellations to your employment must be reported to and approved both by your academic/co-op advisor and by a DSO in OGS. These changes include: Employer Location Date Number of hours worked per week (full-time/part-time) Cancellations Other corrections Once authorized for CPT, F-1 students must comply with the authorization granted. How CPT affects OPT Eligibility If an F-1 student exceeds 364 days of full-time CPT (more than 20 hours per week at a degree level—bachelor’s, master’s or doctorate), they will lose their eligibility to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) at that degree level. Part-time CPT (20 hours per week or less) does not accrue time towards the 364-day calculation. When counting CPT days, every day between the start and end date of CPT is included (including the start and end dates). The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization, not the days the student actually worked. This means even if it was a weekend, holiday, vacation etc., it still counts if the student had CPT authorization. It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full-time CPT days have been used per degree level. Students can use previously issued I-20s to document this. Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this e-form . As a reminder, CPT is a benefit of F-1 status, not a guarantee. While students may be able to work up to 364 days while maintaining OPT eligibility, CPT authorization is directly tied to a student’s academic curriculum. Therefore, the amount of CPT for which students are eligible and may be authorized is entirely based on their program of study, as well as F-1 federal regulations. Simply because an F-1 student has not engaged in 364 days of full-time CPT does not necessarily mean the student is eligible for additional CPT or an extension of a current CPT authorization. Change of Status and SEVIS Transfer Students Change of Status Students Full-time students who have applied to change their immigration status to F-1 within the U.S. (application through USICS) or by traveling (via consular processing) may be eligible to use time from a previous immigration status towards accruing benefits, such as CPT, as long as the student has previously maintained full-time enrollment requirements. Please contact OGS to make an appointment with a DSO to discuss CPT eligibility and bring all applicable documentation with you (e.g. official transcripts, a copy of your I-797 approval notice if you changed status within the U.S.). SEVIS Transfer Students International students with Active F-1 records who transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University may be eligible to use enrolled time at the previous institution towards the one academic year requirement for CPT eligibility. Please contact OGS to make an appointment with a DSO to discuss CPT eligibility and have all applicable documentation available (e.g. official transcripts and your previous I-20) Key Resources CPT Authorization Request Form » This e-form is to request authorization for Curricular Practical Training. CPT Update e-form » This form is intended only for updates to existing CPT authorization – it is not intended for students who are requesting new periods of CPT authorization or who are trying to extend their CPT authorization for new academic terms.

Related Articles: Social Security Number Unauthorized Employment Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × Can I request CPT authorization in my final term of study? The Office of Global Services will only authorize CPT in a student’s final term if the practical training experience is required for degree completion. Can I request CPT authorization for my independent study course? Independent study courses do not qualify for CPT authorization. Do I need CPT authorization for an internship or co-op that is unpaid? Yes! All work associated with an experiential learning opportunity requires CPT authorization, even if it is unpaid. Is there a limit to the number of hours per week I can work while authorized for CPT? In order to know the answer to this, you will need to understand what kind of CPT authorization you have. You can find this information on the second page of your I-20. If your I-20 states you have part-time CPT, then this means you can never exceed 20 hours per week. If your I-20 states you have full-time CPT, then this means there is no limit to the number of hours per week you can work. However, you must always check with your advisor or co-op coordinator to see if they have a limit to the number of hours per week you can work. Do I need CPT authorization for training dates that occur prior to employment? Yes, all training dates require prior CPT authorization. Remember, even time spend while you are not being paid requires CPT authorization. How will I know if I have received CPT authorization? You will know if you have CPT authorization by checking the second page of your most recent I-20. On the second page of your I-20, you will see all the details of your employment authorization. Can I take additional courses while I'm participating in a co-op/internship/clinical rotation? If you would like to enroll in courses while you are participating in a co-op/internship/clinical rotation, you must check with your co-op department or advisor to see if there are academic or university restrictions that would prevent you from doing so. Can I have an on-campus job while I am authorized for CPT during a co-op/internship/clinical rotation? Yes, students are allowed to work on-campus while they also have CPT. However, students are not allowed to work on an SGA (Stipended Graduate Assistantship) and be authorized for CPT for a paid experience at the same time. Please keep in mind that some colleges may not allow you to work on-campus and be on coop at the same time or may have restrictions on how much on-campus employment is allowed while on coop. If this is the case, you will need to follow your co-op department’s rules. My employer offered to extend my co-op/internship on a part-time basis. Can I do this? If your employer offers to extend your co-op/internship on a part-time basis, you must inquire with your academic department to determine if the extension is curricular and is integral to your course of study. If it is determined that the continuation of your co-op/internship is integral to your course of study, you may be eligible to request CPT authorization again. If the continuation of the co-op/internship is not supported academically, you may be eligible to apply for Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training (Pre-OPT). Does part-time CPT count towards the 364 day mark that affects my OPT eligibility? No, part-time CPT authorization does not count towards the 364 days of authorization that would impact OPT eligibility. How can I find out how much CPT time I've used? You can calculate how much CPT time you’ve used by looking at past I-20s. You can also request documentation of your previous CPT authorizations from OGS by filling out the following e-form. Do I need CPT authorization if Northeastern is my employer during co-op/internship/clinical rotation? Students must be authorized for CPT for any experiential learning they conduct, on- or off-campus, paid or unpaid. Students who pursue experiential learning with Northeastern as their employer require CPT authorization. Can I end my CPT earlier than the original end date? Students must consult with their co-op and/or academic advisor if there will be any changes to their approved Co-op/CPT employment in order to ensure that all academic requirements will be met (this link is specific to Co-op requirements). Then, students must follow up with OGS by completing the CPT Update E-form to report changes to OGS in order to receive an updated I-20. How do I find who my authorized secondary approver for CPT is? Authorized secondary approvers are often co-op coordinators or academic advisors for programs that involve experiential learning other than co-op. The lists of authorized secondary approvers for CPT can be found here: Undergraduate students Graduate students I am pursuing a double/combined major. How do I know if my opportunity is eligible for CPT? Students are only eligible for CPT authorization if their opportunity is directly related to their major area of study. For students with double or combined majors, the opportunity may be related to either major. This criteria is confirmed by the students authorized secondary approver, as they have the required understanding about student’s major/curriculum to make this determination.",

Students enrolled in such programs will only begin to accrue time toward CPT eligibility once they have fully matriculated into a degree-seeking program *Limited exceptions to the completion of one academic year may apply in the following circumstances: For students in graduate-level programs that require immediate participation in experiential learning for program completion For students who completed one academic year in another visa status or institution changed to F-1 status within the U.S. or by travel and re-entry, who otherwise qualify Change of Status and SEVIS Transfer Students please review “Change of Status and Transfer Students” below for more information Maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence during every required term of study Review the OGS Guidelines on Maintaining Status for more information A huge part of your responsibility of maintaining your F-1 status is by actively participating in your academic activities in person. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term. As an international student, this prolonged absence may impact your F-1 status and your long-term academic goals as well as future immigration benefits.

This includes any required term when a student is engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization. Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during non-required terms. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In person (Traditional): All engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Hybrid: The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Remote (Online): The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer’s physical location Full-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization To maintain on-ground presence during a required term while pursuing full-time experiential learning, students have the following options: Option 1 : Engaging on-site (in person) at the employer’s physical location. This can be in-person or hybrid, as defined above Students will be maintaining on-ground presence based on their engagement with the employer Option 2 : Engaging remotely with the employer with simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course Students should enroll in an on-ground course stipulated by their academic program, which must run for the duration of the required academic term. Students should work with their academic department/advisor/co-op advisor to identify a course that is appropriate. Co-op students only : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements. If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor. Part-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization F-1 Students engaged remotely in part-time practical training/experiential learning must couple their part-time practical experience course enrollment with only on-ground courses to meet both the on-ground requirement and the full-time status requirement. As such, students engaging in part-time co-ops are not eligible to maintain their on-ground presence through the EXED course and may not enroll in online classes to meet the minimum credit requirements for the term. Experiential Learning with an Overseas Employer with CPT Authorization F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain their on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above. Failure to Maintain On-Ground Presence If an F-1 student withdraws from or fails to attend their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training, it will be considered a violation of status and the student’s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated. Regardless of the modality of the practical experience, students need regular engagement with both the practical training provider as well as the academic program to confirm successful progression of the practical training experience. Travel during Experiential Learning Engaging on-site at your employer’s physical location or participating in a university designated on-ground course is a mandatory to maintain the on-ground presence required by your F-1 student status. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term, as their F-1 status and academic goals may be negatively impacted. In cases where travel outside of the U.S. cannot be avoided, we highly recommend that students limit their absence from the U.S. and in-person classes as much as possible. If students choose to travel during a required term, they are taking on the associated risks, including but not limited to scrutiny by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) upon re-entry to the U.S. as well as scrutiny when applying for future immigration status or benefits."

Part-time CPT (20 hours per week or less) does not accrue time towards the 364-day calculation. When counting CPT days, every day between the start and end date of CPT is included (including the start and end dates). The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization, not the days the student actually worked. This means even if it was a weekend, holiday, vacation etc., it still counts if the student had CPT authorization. It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full-time CPT days have been used per degree level. Students can use previously issued I-20s to document this. Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this e-form . As a reminder, CPT is a benefit of F-1 status, not a guarantee. While students may be able to work up to 364 days while maintaining OPT eligibility, CPT authorization is directly tied to a student’s academic curriculum. Therefore, the amount of CPT for which students are eligible and may be authorized is entirely based on their program of study, as well as F-1 federal regulations. Simply because an F-1 student has not engaged in 364 days of full-time CPT does not necessarily mean the student is eligible for additional CPT or an extension of a current CPT authorization."

You can also visit the Department of State website to find our more about the specifics of the travel ban. Northeastern Executive Order Site Department of State website Executive order timeline January 29, 2018 – Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rules against third travel ban During the first week in December, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on President Trump’s third travel ban. On Dec. 22, 2017, the Ninth Circuit issued a decision that partially blocked the third travel ban. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the travel ban will not be enforced against “foreign nationals who have a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in December, however, supersedes the Ninth Circuit’s decision. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Trump administration could fully implement and enforce the third travel ban on all eight countries. On Jan. 6, 2018, the Trump administration petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit’s decision, which the U.S. Supreme Court granted on Jan. 19.  The U.S. Supreme Court will consider 4 questions: Whether courts can review a challenge to the travel ban executive order at all; Whether the executive order falls within the president’s authority over immigration; Whether the Hawaii district court’s order applies too broadly; and Whether the executive order violates the Constitution’s establishment clause At this time, the Fourth Circuit has not issued a decision. Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available.  Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions. December 8, 2017 – USA Supreme Court allows Trump to enforce travel ban until lower courts rule on challenges The U.S. Supreme Court issued an order on Dec. 4, 2017, allowing the Trump administration to implement fully and enforce its newest travel ban while lower courts continue to consider challenges to it. Travel restrictions, which vary by country, will affect certain nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen, unless exempt or granted a waiver pursuant to a presidential proclamation that was issued on Sept. 24. The Trump administration had previously been barred from implementing the ban on its intended effective date of Oct. 18, 2017, after two lower federal courts issued injunctions that temporarily enjoined enforcement of most of the ban’s restrictions. Following the Trump administration’s appeal of those rulings and request for temporary permission to implement the proclamation, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the ban to take effect partially, but exempted travelers with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity in the United States. The Dec. 4 order by the Supreme Court removes the relationship exemption and allows the Trump administration to implement the ban fully while challenges continue in the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and the Ninth Circuits. Specific travel restrictions Effective Dec. 8, 2017, the Trump administration will fully implement the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dec. 4, 2017, order, and nationals of the eight countries will be subject to the following U.S. travel limitations, unless otherwise exempt: • Chad: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas • Iran: No nonimmigrant visas except F and M student visas and J exchange visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas • Libya: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas • North Korea: No nonimmigrant, immigrant, or diversity lottery visas • Somalia: Nonimmigrant visa applicants subject to heightened scrutiny; no immigrant or diversity visas • Syria: No nonimmigrant, immigrant, or diversity lottery visas • Venezuela: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visas for officials of designated Venezuelan government agencies; other visa holders are subject to verification of traveler information; no restrictions on immigrant or diversity lottery visas • Yemen: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas Exemptions and waivers Several classes of foreign nationals are exempt from the restrictions, including U.S. lawful permanent residents, dual nationals traveling on a passport from a non-restricted country, foreign nationals who hold a valid U.S. visa or advance parole, and those who were physically in the United States on the applicable original effective date of the travel restrictions. Those who are not exempt may request a waiver when applying for a visa. To be eligible for a waiver, a foreign national must demonstrate that he or she would suffer undue hardship if denied entry, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety and would be in U.S. national interest. Waivers are discretionary and may be difficult to obtain. What this means for travelers Foreign nationals who are currently in the United States, hold a passport from a restricted country (other than exempt dual nationals), and would need to apply for a visa to reenter the United States should carefully consider the risks of international travel and the potential for significant delays. As a reminder, all foreign nationals—including those exempt from the travel restrictions—are subject to national security screening and the potential for additional vetting when applying for a U.S. visa or admission to the United States. Looking ahead The travel restrictions will be implemented while the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal continue to hear challenges to the presidential proclamation. The Ninth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec. 6, 2017, while the Fourth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec. 8, 2017. Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available. Please contact the university’s Office of Global Services at [email protected] if you have any questions. October 26, 2017 – The Department of Homeland Security began requiring airlines to implement enhanced security measures for flights destined to the USA These enhanced security measures include enhanced screening of passengers and their electronic devices as well as an increase in security standards for aircrafts and airports. More information on the new security standards can be found in the DHS Fact Sheet: Aviation Enhanced Security Measures for All Commercial Flights to the United States. September 27, 2017 – Country-specific travel ban issued President Trump issued a proclamation that imposes new travel restrictions on eight countries. Five of the eight countries—Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen—were included in the previous travel ban, while three countries—Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela—were added to the revised list. The new restrictions were issued on Sept. 24, 2017, just as the old 90-day travel ban expired, and will go into effect on Oct. 18. Until then, by virtue of the proclamation, the “old” travel ban will continue for individuals from those countries still on the list who do not have a bona fide relationship with a U.S. person or entity. The new restrictions will not be applied to: Current lawful permanent residents Current visa holders Dual nationals traveling on a passport from an unaffected country Asylees Refugees already admitted to the U.S. Individuals granted protection under the Convention Against Torture Restrictions by country: Chad, Libya, and Yemen: Entry as immigrants and non immigrants in business and tourist status is suspended. Iran: Entry as immigrants and nonimmigrants is suspended, except for those in valid student (F and M) or exchange visitor (J) status. Syria and North Korea: Entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants is suspended. Venezuela: Entry in tourist or business visitor status is suspended for officials of certain government agencies involved in screening and vetting practices and their immediate family members. Somalia: Entry as immigrants is suspended and decisions regarding entry as non immigrants will be subject to additional scrutiny. Although Iraq is not technically covered by the new restrictions, the proclamation notes that Iraqi nationals will be subject to additional scrutiny. How long these restrictions will last is uncertain. Countries may be removed or added to the list based upon further review of the effectiveness of their security practices. Waivers will be available on “undue hardship” grounds if a consulate determines the entry would not pose a threat to national security and the admission would be in the national interest. This could include individuals who have already been admitted to the U.S. for extended periods of time. The Supreme Court was set to hear the travel ban case on Oct. 10. The justices canceled that hearing and asked the parties to submit new briefs by Oct. 5. Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available. Please contact the university’s Office of Global Services if you have any questions. August 8, 2017 - State Department updates policy guidance on F-1 student visa applications On Aug. 8, the Department of State revised its guidance to consular officers when considering F-1 student visas. The modification provides assistance to consular officers in determining whether an F-1 visa applicant plans to leave the United States after graduation. Due to these changes, students applying for F-1 visas may be asked additional questions regarding their long-term plans and their ties to their home country. The revised policy guidelines can be found here: https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM040205.html .

September 1, 2017 - State Department replaces “30/60 Day Rule” On Sept. 1, the Department of State eliminated the “30/60 Day Rule” regarding adjustment of status applications. This rule assisted officials in determining whether an individual would be inadmissible due to inconsistent conduct. The “90 Day Rule” replaced the prior rule and applies to both immigrant and non-immigrant visa applicants. The new rule provides individuals seeking an adjustment of status less flexibility to postpone filings. The “90 Day Rule” can be found here: https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM030209.html . September 13, 2017 – Trump Administration imposes visa sanctions on four countries On Sept. 13, the Trump administration imposed visa sanctions on Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. According to officials, these four countries have refused to accept or have unreasonably delayed accepting deportees who have been convicted of crimes in the United States. Not all visas have been discontinued. The Department of Homeland Security’s announcement regarding the specific visa sanctions can be found here: https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/13/dhs-announces-implementation-visa-sanctions-four-countries .

On March 15, one day before President Trump’s revised executive order was slated to go into effect, the U.S. District Court in Hawaii issued a nationwide temporary block preventing the government from enforcing or implementing Section 2 (90-day travel ban) and Section 6 (120-day U.S. refugee program suspension) of the revised order. Also, early on March 16, the U.S. District Court in Maryland issued a separate ruling barring enforcement nationwide of the 90-day travel ban. Other sections of the revised executive order not included in the court’s decision became effective at 12:01 a.m. ET on March 16, including Section 5 (uniform screening and vetting standards for all immigration programs), Section 7 (rescission of exercise of authority relating to terrorism grounds of inadmissibility), Section 8 (expedited completion of biometric entry-exit tracking system), Section 9 (visa interview security), and Section 10 (visa validity reciprocity). The U.S. Department of State announced that due to the litigation, U.S. embassies and consulates will continue to process visas for nationals of the six targeted countries. Nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen may continue to travel into the U.S. for the immediate future, if otherwise admissible. The university continues to follow the situation closely and will update this page as further information becomes available. Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions. March 8, 2017 President Trump has signed a revised executive order that will suspend the entry of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for a period of 90 days beginning March 16 at 12:01 a.m. ET. The new order rescinds the president’s Jan. 27 travel ban, which a federal court suspended last month. The new travel restrictions will be in effect through June 14, 2017. However, the order indicates that ban could be extended and additional countries could be subject to restrictions. Who is subject to the revised executive order? The executive order prohibits nationals of the six restricted countries from entering the United States unless they qualify for an exemption or are granted a waiver. Iraqi nationals are no longer included in the ban. The order also suspends the admission of refugees from any country, including Syria, for 120 days as of March 16. The following classes of foreign nationals will be exempt from the ban: U.S. lawful permanent residents (green card holders) Holders of a valid U.S. visa, even if they have not yet used it (Visas that were provisionally revoked under the Jan. 27 executive order should be valid for travel. Foreign nationals with a visa that was physically cancelled under the Jan. 27 executive order may be entitled to a new travel document for entry to the U.S.) Dual nationals traveling on a valid passport from a non-restricted country (Dual nationals must hold a valid U.S. visa or be visa-exempt.) Foreign nationals holding a valid advance parole document Foreign nationals holding a valid A, C-2, G, or NATO visa Foreign nationals granted asylum Refugees already admitted to the U.S. and those with travel formally scheduled by the State Department Once the order is in effect, non-exempt nationals of the restricted countries will be prohibited from entering the U.S. for the duration of the ban unless they are granted a waiver. Until the new executive order takes effect, the Department of State indicates that it will continue to process visa applications from nationals of the six restricted countries. However, applicants should be prepared for lengthy security screening and the possibility that they may not be issued a visa before the entry ban takes effect. Waivers of the entry ban The executive order permits the Departments of Homeland Security and State to grant discretionary waivers of the entry ban. Waiver applicants must show that a denial of entry would cause undue hardship and that their entry is in the national interest and would not pose a threat to national security . The executive order suggests that a waiver may be appropriate for several classes of foreign nationals, including: (1) individuals previously admitted to the U.S. for a continuous period of work, study, or another long-term activity who are seeking to resume that activity; (2) individuals with previously established significant contacts with the U.S.; (3) individuals with significant business or professional obligations in the U.S.; (4) individuals seeking to visit or reside with a close family member; (5) individuals who are infants, young children or adoptees, or needing urgent medical care, or otherwise justified by the special circumstances; (6) individuals employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government; (7) individuals who are permanent Canadian residents applying for a visa in Canada; and (8) individuals traveling as a U.S. government-sponsored exchange visitor. Given the stringent criteria, however, waivers may be difficult to obtain. Processing of immigration applications and petitions The executive order limits the Department of State interview waiver program for nonimmigrant visa applicants. Though foreign nationals from non-restricted countries may still qualify for an exemption from an in-person visa interview, visa applicants should check the website of the relevant U.S. consulate for specific information, which is subject to frequent change. In addition to the entry ban, the president has issued a memorandum directing the Departments of Homeland Security, State, and Justice to implement more stringent vetting of applications and petitions for immigration benefits. Enhanced security screening could take effect quickly, and may delay processing at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and at U.S. consulates. February 27, 2017 – Immigration Executive Orders: Your Rights & the Current Climate ISEC, 102 COLUMBUS AVENUE, 3pm Megan Kludt, Esq. of Curran & Berger LLP will be the featured speaker.

All Northeastern students are welcome. Registration is requested for the event. To register, please email [email protected] February 9, 2017 –USA 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to continue blocking President Trump’s travel ban The unanimous decision temporarily keeps in place a stay preventing a ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. The Department of Homeland Security has directed its agency to adjudicate applications and petitions filed for or on behalf of individuals in the U.S., regardless of their country of origin. Also, all U.S. ports of entry will resume admission of non-immigrant and immigrant visa holders, including refugees, according to policies and procedures existing prior to the Executive Order. The Court of Appeals instructed attorneys for each party to file briefs by 11 a.m. on Thursday, Feb. 16, arguing whether the government’s motion for a stay should be considered again by the entire appeals court. To hold a rehearing, a majority of the 29 active judges on the court would need to vote in favor of that motion. We will continue to provide updates on the pending litigation. Please contact the Office of Global Services or We Care if you have any questions. February 5, 2017 –President Aoun’s Statement “To all members of the Northeastern University community: For the past decade, we have joined together to make Northeastern a truly global university. In doing so, we have set forth a series of core values such as the value of inclusivity and a bedrock belief that diversity makes our community stronger. I find the president’s executive order restricting international travel to be antithetical to our core values and completely unacceptable. I say this as an educator and as an American who came to this country as an international student. Throughout the past week, I have had the opportunity to speak to many in our community who are directly affected by this new reality. I have listened to their stories and seen the anxiety etched in their faces. To the 250 Northeastern students and 31 faculty and staff impacted by this executive order: Your story is my story. You have my unwavering pledge that your university will stand by you, safeguard you, and be your home away from home. To my faculty and staff colleagues: Ensuring that all in our community can achieve their dreams without disruption is our highest priority. It is an honor to work with you on this charge. As we all know, Northeastern never stands idly by, observing from the sidelines. On Friday, we joined seven other leading universities in filing an amicus brief in federal court. Our brief makes clear that the executive order imperils our ability to have students and scholars collaborate and advance knowledge across borders. The order represents a threat to the mission of global higher education. In the aftermath of this executive order, it has become abundantly clear that the integration of diverse people, ideas, and cultures—which universities like Northeastern make possible—is more important than ever before. Let us turn this challenge into opportunity. Together, we will seize this moment to reaffirm our core values and strengthen our commitment to being a diverse, inclusive, and truly global university. I look forward to achieving this important work together. Sincerely, Joseph E. Aoun President” February 5, 2017 – Events planned for Community Members Affected by the Executive Order Lunch Invite: Invitation to Students, Scholars, and Faculty for Community Members Affected by the Executive Order Tuesday, Feb. 7, 1-3 p.m., Curry Student Center Ballroom It has been a stressful week and we would like to invite everyone to come together. The Office of Global Services invites you to join us for an informal catered lunch where we will provide informal updates about campus support services and information on upcoming events. Click here to register Understanding the Executive Order and Implications for Our Community Wednesday, Feb. 8, 10-11:30 a.m., Curry Student Center Ballroom Faculty and staff from Northeastern’s School of Law, Office of General Counsel, Office of Global Services, as well as local immigration attorneys will provide an overview of what the Executive Order is, the implications behind the stay, the appeal process, and what this all means for Northeastern community members. The panel will discuss the differences between status adjustments (such as program extension or CPT) at the university level versus adjudications that need to be done by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. February 4, 2017 – US Citizenship and Immigration Services Update For students concerned about applying for Optional Practical Training (OPT), the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services continues to adjudicate applications and petitions filed on behalf of individuals in the United States regardless of their country of origin, and applications and petitions of lawful permanent residents outside the U.S. Applications to adjust status also continue to be adjudicated, according to existing policies and procedures, for applicants who are nationals of countries designated in the Jan. 27, 2017, “ Executive Order: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States .” February 4, 2017 – No Current Plans to Expand Travel Ban Beyond Current Countries The Department of State confirmed that there is no addendum, annex, or amendment now being worked on to expand visa revocations or the travel ban to countries other than those currently implicated in the Executive Order. February 4, 2017 – Clarification from DHS and DOS re: Implementation of Executive Order on Immigration On Friday, Feb. 3, and effective immediately, a federal judge in Seattle issued a ruling that temporarily blocks President Trump’s week-old immigration order from being enforced nationwide. Following the decision, the Department of Homeland Security said it has suspended all actions to implement the president’s immigration order. The department will resume inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the executive order, according to a DHS statement. Meanwhile, the State Department said it has reversed the cancellation of visas that were provisionally revoked following the travel ban—so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled. According to Customs and Border Protection, individuals who had their visas physically canceled as a result of the executive order will not need to reapply for a new visa. Absent any other admissibility issues, those individuals will receive an I-193 waiver (Application for Waiver of Passport and/or Visa) upon arrival to the U.S. For those traveling by air, airlines have been instructed to contact Customs and Border Protection to receive authorization to permit boarding. On Sunday, Feb. 5, a federal appeals court rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore the executive order. We continue to monitor all legal and implementation decisions related to the executive order and will provide information as it becomes available. February 1, 2017 – Travel Alert Under President Trump’s Immigration Executive Order On January 27, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order suspending immigrant and non-immigrant admissions to the U.S. for at least 90 days for individuals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The Executive Order did not specifically categorize what categories of “individuals” (i.e., the definition of “ individuals from ”) are subject to the ban. This broad generalization has led to widespread confusion at ports of entry across the U.S., but since then the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has stated that travelers will be treated according to the travel document (passport) they present at the border. See https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/29/protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states Federal judges in several jurisdictions issued court rulings to stay the terms of the Executive Order that would have led to the removal of foreign nationals who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa or status as a lawful permanent resident (green card holder). These stays remain in effect but may be temporary. These court orders also do not apply to airports with pre-clearance facilities (Dublin & Shannon, Ireland; Aruba; Freeport & Nassau, The Bahamas; Bermuda; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and Calgary, Toronto, Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver, and Winnipeg, Canada). Nationals of the seven affected countries should avoid flying into the U.S. from these airports. These court orders do not mean that anyone arriving with a visa is guaranteed entry. People with a non-immigrant (temporary) visa from those 7 countries will be denied entry unless they can show that their admission is in the national interest and they do not pose a security threat. Citizens of the affected countries who hold dual citizenship with the U.S. should not be directly affected. Non-U.S. citizens who hold dual citizenship with the affected countries and one other foreign country may be subject to the ban. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant deemed a threat to national security or public safety. This ban may include individuals who have traveled to one or more of the designated countries as well, even if they do not hold a nationality of one of the designated countries. Additional screening for those who have been in these countries should be expected, including the search and examination of luggage, mobile phones, computers, and electronics, including social media pages for any anti-American communications or posts. Green card holders returning to the U.S. after a short time abroad have the legal right to return to the U.S., barring exceptional circumstances. On January 29, 2017, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security released a statement that “the entry of lawful permanent residents” is in the national interest. Further, U.S. Embassies and Consulates across the world have been instructed not to issue any non-immigrant or immigrant visas to persons from the affected countries, consistent with the Executive Order. Also, individuals from one of the affected countries who have a pending immigration petition or application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may experience delays in the adjudication of their cases. The Executive Order also contemplates that additional countries could be added to the banned list.  Accordingly, until more information becomes available, and given the possibility of a change in government policy that could go into effect immediately, all foreign nationals should carefully assess whether it is worth the risk to travel outside the United States. We recommend that international students and scholars should not travel outside of the U.S. without speaking with an advisor at the Office of Global Services (OGS) and/or seeking advice from personal legal counsel who can review individual circumstances for potential available options or possible relief from the consequences of the Executive Order. The OGS can provide you with a list of personal immigration attorneys and a list of pro bono service providers. The OGS is working with offices and key stakeholders throughout the university to offer resources and support for international students and scholars. Joseph Aoun, President of Northeastern University, sent a message to the entire Northeastern community on January 28, 2017, stating: “Let us strengthen our resolve to be a welcoming community that embraces the immeasurable benefits of diversity and inclusion. All in our community—especially those who feel vulnerable as a result of this new paradigm—should feel safe and secure at Northeastern. We, the leadership of the university, stand with you and will pursue every means available to safeguard each of you—students, faculty, and staff.” This alert is not legal advice. We will continue to provide updated information and guidance as it becomes available. Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions ×",

                "section_content": "Executive order timeline January 29, 2018 – Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rules against third travel ban During the first week in December, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on President Trump’s third travel ban. On Dec. 22, 2017, the Ninth Circuit issued a decision that partially blocked the third travel ban. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the travel ban will not be enforced against “foreign nationals who have a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in December, however, supersedes the Ninth Circuit’s decision. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Trump administration could fully implement and enforce the third travel ban on all eight countries. On Jan. 6, 2018, the Trump administration petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit’s decision, which the U.S. Supreme Court granted on Jan. 19.  The U.S. Supreme Court will consider 4 questions: Whether courts can review a challenge to the travel ban executive order at all; Whether the executive order falls within the president’s authority over immigration; Whether the Hawaii district court’s order applies too broadly; and Whether the executive order violates the Constitution’s establishment clause At this time, the Fourth Circuit has not issued a decision. Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available.  Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions. December 8, 2017 – USA Supreme Court allows Trump to enforce travel ban until lower courts rule on challenges The U.S. Supreme Court issued an order on Dec. 4, 2017, allowing the Trump administration to implement fully and enforce its newest travel ban while lower courts continue to consider challenges to it. Travel restrictions, which vary by country, will affect certain nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen, unless exempt or granted a waiver pursuant to a presidential proclamation that was issued on Sept. 24. The Trump administration had previously been barred from implementing the ban on its intended effective date of Oct. 18, 2017, after two lower federal courts issued injunctions that temporarily enjoined enforcement of most of the ban’s restrictions. Following the Trump administration’s appeal of those rulings and request for temporary permission to implement the proclamation, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the ban to take effect partially, but exempted travelers with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity in the United States. The Dec. 4 order by the Supreme Court removes the relationship exemption and allows the Trump administration to implement the ban fully while challenges continue in the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and the Ninth Circuits. Specific travel restrictions Effective Dec. 8, 2017, the Trump administration will fully implement the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dec. 4, 2017, order, and nationals of the eight countries will be subject to the following U.S. travel limitations, unless otherwise exempt: • Chad: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas • Iran: No nonimmigrant visas except F and M student visas and J exchange visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas • Libya: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas • North Korea: No nonimmigrant, immigrant, or diversity lottery visas • Somalia: Nonimmigrant visa applicants subject to heightened scrutiny; no immigrant or diversity visas • Syria: No nonimmigrant, immigrant, or diversity lottery visas • Venezuela: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visas for officials of designated Venezuelan government agencies; other visa holders are subject to verification of traveler information; no restrictions on immigrant or diversity lottery visas • Yemen: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas Exemptions and waivers Several classes of foreign nationals are exempt from the restrictions, including U.S. lawful permanent residents, dual nationals traveling on a passport from a non-restricted country, foreign nationals who hold a valid U.S. visa or advance parole, and those who were physically in the United States on the applicable original effective date of the travel restrictions. Those who are not exempt may request a waiver when applying for a visa. To be eligible for a waiver, a foreign national must demonstrate that he or she would suffer undue hardship if denied entry, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety and would be in U.S. national interest. Waivers are discretionary and may be difficult to obtain. What this means for travelers Foreign nationals who are currently in the United States, hold a passport from a restricted country (other than exempt dual nationals), and would need to apply for a visa to reenter the United States should carefully consider the risks of international travel and the potential for significant delays. As a reminder, all foreign nationals—including those exempt from the travel restrictions—are subject to national security screening and the potential for additional vetting when applying for a U.S. visa or admission to the United States. Looking ahead The travel restrictions will be implemented while the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal continue to hear challenges to the presidential proclamation. The Ninth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec. 6, 2017, while the Fourth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec. 8, 2017. Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available.

October 26, 2017 – The Department of Homeland Security began requiring airlines to implement enhanced security measures for flights destined to the USA These enhanced security measures include enhanced screening of passengers and their electronic devices as well as an increase in security standards for aircrafts and airports. More information on the new security standards can be found in the DHS Fact Sheet: Aviation Enhanced Security Measures for All Commercial Flights to the United States. September 27, 2017 – Country-specific travel ban issued President Trump issued a proclamation that imposes new travel restrictions on eight countries. Five of the eight countries—Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen—were included in the previous travel ban, while three countries—Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela—were added to the revised list. The new restrictions were issued on Sept. 24, 2017, just as the old 90-day travel ban expired, and will go into effect on Oct. 18. Until then, by virtue of the proclamation, the “old” travel ban will continue for individuals from those countries still on the list who do not have a bona fide relationship with a U.S. person or entity. The new restrictions will not be applied to: Current lawful permanent residents Current visa holders Dual nationals traveling on a passport from an unaffected country Asylees Refugees already admitted to the U.S. Individuals granted protection under the Convention Against Torture Restrictions by country: Chad, Libya, and Yemen: Entry as immigrants and non immigrants in business and tourist status is suspended. Iran: Entry as immigrants and nonimmigrants is suspended, except for those in valid student (F and M) or exchange visitor (J) status. Syria and North Korea: Entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants is suspended. Venezuela: Entry in tourist or business visitor status is suspended for officials of certain government agencies involved in screening and vetting practices and their immediate family members. Somalia: Entry as immigrants is suspended and decisions regarding entry as non immigrants will be subject to additional scrutiny. Although Iraq is not technically covered by the new restrictions, the proclamation notes that Iraqi nationals will be subject to additional scrutiny. How long these restrictions will last is uncertain. Countries may be removed or added to the list based upon further review of the effectiveness of their security practices. Waivers will be available on “undue hardship” grounds if a consulate determines the entry would not pose a threat to national security and the admission would be in the national interest. This could include individuals who have already been admitted to the U.S. for extended periods of time. The Supreme Court was set to hear the travel ban case on Oct. 10. The justices canceled that hearing and asked the parties to submit new briefs by Oct. 5. Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available. Please contact the university’s Office of Global Services if you have any questions. August 8, 2017 - State Department updates policy guidance on F-1 student visa applications On Aug. 8, the Department of State revised its guidance to consular officers when considering F-1 student visas. The modification provides assistance to consular officers in determining whether an F-1 visa applicant plans to leave the United States after graduation. Due to these changes, students applying for F-1 visas may be asked additional questions regarding their long-term plans and their ties to their home country. The revised policy guidelines can be found here: https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM040205.html . Northeastern will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available about the revised guidance. Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions. August 28, 2017 - In-person interviews for employment-based green card applicants to begin Oct. 1 Beginning on Oct. 1, in-person interviews will be required for all applicants seeking an employment-based green card. In the past, in-person interviews could be waived if no additional information was needed. Citizenship and Immigration Services stated that the in-person interviews will allow officers to verify information in applications, discover new relevant information, and assist with evaluating the credibility of applicants. More information about the in-person interviews can be found here: https://www.uscis.gov/news/news-releases/uscis-to-expand-in-person-interview-requirements-for-certain-permanent-residency-applicants . September 1, 2017 - State Department replaces “30/60 Day Rule” On Sept. 1, the Department of State eliminated the “30/60 Day Rule” regarding adjustment of status applications. This rule assisted officials in determining whether an individual would be inadmissible due to inconsistent conduct. The “90 Day Rule” replaced the prior rule and applies to both immigrant and non-immigrant visa applicants. The new rule provides individuals seeking an adjustment of status less flexibility to postpone filings. The “90 Day Rule” can be found here: https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM030209.html . September 13, 2017 – Trump Administration imposes visa sanctions on four countries On Sept. 13, the Trump administration imposed visa sanctions on Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. According to officials, these four countries have refused to accept or have unreasonably delayed accepting deportees who have been convicted of crimes in the United States. Not all visas have been discontinued. The Department of Homeland Security’s announcement regarding the specific visa sanctions can be found here: https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/13/dhs-announces-implementation-visa-sanctions-four-countries .

On March 15, one day before President Trump’s revised executive order was slated to go into effect, the U.S. District Court in Hawaii issued a nationwide temporary block preventing the government from enforcing or implementing Section 2 (90-day travel ban) and Section 6 (120-day U.S. refugee program suspension) of the revised order. Also, early on March 16, the U.S. District Court in Maryland issued a separate ruling barring enforcement nationwide of the 90-day travel ban. Other sections of the revised executive order not included in the court’s decision became effective at 12:01 a.m. ET on March 16, including Section 5 (uniform screening and vetting standards for all immigration programs), Section 7 (rescission of exercise of authority relating to terrorism grounds of inadmissibility), Section 8 (expedited completion of biometric entry-exit tracking system), Section 9 (visa interview security), and Section 10 (visa validity reciprocity). The U.S. Department of State announced that due to the litigation, U.S. embassies and consulates will continue to process visas for nationals of the six targeted countries. Nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen may continue to travel into the U.S. for the immediate future, if otherwise admissible. The university continues to follow the situation closely and will update this page as further information becomes available. Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions. March 8, 2017 President Trump has signed a revised executive order that will suspend the entry of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for a period of 90 days beginning March 16 at 12:01 a.m. ET. The new order rescinds the president’s Jan. 27 travel ban, which a federal court suspended last month. The new travel restrictions will be in effect through June 14, 2017. However, the order indicates that ban could be extended and additional countries could be subject to restrictions. Who is subject to the revised executive order? The executive order prohibits nationals of the six restricted countries from entering the United States unless they qualify for an exemption or are granted a waiver. Iraqi nationals are no longer included in the ban. The order also suspends the admission of refugees from any country, including Syria, for 120 days as of March 16. The following classes of foreign nationals will be exempt from the ban: U.S. lawful permanent residents (green card holders) Holders of a valid U.S. visa, even if they have not yet used it (Visas that were provisionally revoked under the Jan. 27 executive order should be valid for travel. Foreign nationals with a visa that was physically cancelled under the Jan. 27 executive order may be entitled to a new travel document for entry to the U.S.) Dual nationals traveling on a valid passport from a non-restricted country (Dual nationals must hold a valid U.S. visa or be visa-exempt.) Foreign nationals holding a valid advance parole document Foreign nationals holding a valid A, C-2, G, or NATO visa Foreign nationals granted asylum Refugees already admitted to the U.S. and those with travel formally scheduled by the State Department Once the order is in effect, non-exempt nationals of the restricted countries will be prohibited from entering the U.S. for the duration of the ban unless they are granted a waiver. Until the new executive order takes effect, the Department of State indicates that it will continue to process visa applications from nationals of the six restricted countries. However, applicants should be prepared for lengthy security screening and the possibility that they may not be issued a visa before the entry ban takes effect. Waivers of the entry ban The executive order permits the Departments of Homeland Security and State to grant discretionary waivers of the entry ban. Waiver applicants must show that a denial of entry would cause undue hardship and that their entry is in the national interest and would not pose a threat to national security . The executive order suggests that a waiver may be appropriate for several classes of foreign nationals, including: (1) individuals previously admitted to the U.S. for a continuous period of work, study, or another long-term activity who are seeking to resume that activity; (2) individuals with previously established significant contacts with the U.S.; (3) individuals with significant business or professional obligations in the U.S.; (4) individuals seeking to visit or reside with a close family member; (5) individuals who are infants, young children or adoptees, or needing urgent medical care, or otherwise justified by the special circumstances; (6) individuals employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government; (7) individuals who are permanent Canadian residents applying for a visa in Canada; and (8) individuals traveling as a U.S. government-sponsored exchange visitor. Given the stringent criteria, however, waivers may be difficult to obtain. Processing of immigration applications and petitions The executive order limits the Department of State interview waiver program for nonimmigrant visa applicants. Though foreign nationals from non-restricted countries may still qualify for an exemption from an in-person visa interview, visa applicants should check the website of the relevant U.S. consulate for specific information, which is subject to frequent change. In addition to the entry ban, the president has issued a memorandum directing the Departments of Homeland Security, State, and Justice to implement more stringent vetting of applications and petitions for immigration benefits. Enhanced security screening could take effect quickly, and may delay processing at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and at U.S. consulates. February 27, 2017 – Immigration Executive Orders: Your Rights & the Current Climate ISEC, 102 COLUMBUS AVENUE, 3pm Megan Kludt, Esq. of Curran & Berger LLP will be the featured speaker.

All Northeastern students are welcome. Registration is requested for the event. To register, please email [email protected] February 9, 2017 –USA 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to continue blocking President Trump’s travel ban The unanimous decision temporarily keeps in place a stay preventing a ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. The Department of Homeland Security has directed its agency to adjudicate applications and petitions filed for or on behalf of individuals in the U.S., regardless of their country of origin. Also, all U.S. ports of entry will resume admission of non-immigrant and immigrant visa holders, including refugees, according to policies and procedures existing prior to the Executive Order. The Court of Appeals instructed attorneys for each party to file briefs by 11 a.m. on Thursday, Feb. 16, arguing whether the government’s motion for a stay should be considered again by the entire appeals court. To hold a rehearing, a majority of the 29 active judges on the court would need to vote in favor of that motion. We will continue to provide updates on the pending litigation. Please contact the Office of Global Services or We Care if you have any questions. February 5, 2017 –President Aoun’s Statement “To all members of the Northeastern University community: For the past decade, we have joined together to make Northeastern a truly global university. In doing so, we have set forth a series of core values such as the value of inclusivity and a bedrock belief that diversity makes our community stronger. I find the president’s executive order restricting international travel to be antithetical to our core values and completely unacceptable. I say this as an educator and as an American who came to this country as an international student. Throughout the past week, I have had the opportunity to speak to many in our community who are directly affected by this new reality. I have listened to their stories and seen the anxiety etched in their faces. To the 250 Northeastern students and 31 faculty and staff impacted by this executive order: Your story is my story. You have my unwavering pledge that your university will stand by you, safeguard you, and be your home away from home. To my faculty and staff colleagues: Ensuring that all in our community can achieve their dreams without disruption is our highest priority. It is an honor to work with you on this charge. As we all know, Northeastern never stands idly by, observing from the sidelines. On Friday, we joined seven other leading universities in filing an amicus brief in federal court. Our brief makes clear that the executive order imperils our ability to have students and scholars collaborate and advance knowledge across borders. The order represents a threat to the mission of global higher education. In the aftermath of this executive order, it has become abundantly clear that the integration of diverse people, ideas, and cultures—which universities like Northeastern make possible—is more important than ever before. Let us turn this challenge into opportunity. Together, we will seize this moment to reaffirm our core values and strengthen our commitment to being a diverse, inclusive, and truly global university. I look forward to achieving this important work together. Sincerely, Joseph E. Aoun President” February 5, 2017 – Events planned for Community Members Affected by the Executive Order Lunch Invite: Invitation to Students, Scholars, and Faculty for Community Members Affected by the Executive Order Tuesday, Feb. 7, 1-3 p.m., Curry Student Center Ballroom It has been a stressful week and we would like to invite everyone to come together. The Office of Global Services invites you to join us for an informal catered lunch where we will provide informal updates about campus support services and information on upcoming events. Click here to register Understanding the Executive Order and Implications for Our Community Wednesday, Feb. 8, 10-11:30 a.m., Curry Student Center Ballroom Faculty and staff from Northeastern’s School of Law, Office of General Counsel, Office of Global Services, as well as local immigration attorneys will provide an overview of what the Executive Order is, the implications behind the stay, the appeal process, and what this all means for Northeastern community members. The panel will discuss the differences between status adjustments (such as program extension or CPT) at the university level versus adjudications that need to be done by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. February 4, 2017 – US Citizenship and Immigration Services Update For students concerned about applying for Optional Practical Training (OPT), the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services continues to adjudicate applications and petitions filed on behalf of individuals in the United States regardless of their country of origin, and applications and petitions of lawful permanent residents outside the U.S. Applications to adjust status also continue to be adjudicated, according to existing policies and procedures, for applicants who are nationals of countries designated in the Jan. 27, 2017, “ Executive Order: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States .” February 4, 2017 – No Current Plans to Expand Travel Ban Beyond Current Countries The Department of State confirmed that there is no addendum, annex, or amendment now being worked on to expand visa revocations or the travel ban to countries other than those currently implicated in the Executive Order. February 4, 2017 – Clarification from DHS and DOS re: Implementation of Executive Order on Immigration On Friday, Feb. 3, and effective immediately, a federal judge in Seattle issued a ruling that temporarily blocks President Trump’s week-old immigration order from being enforced nationwide. Following the decision, the Department of Homeland Security said it has suspended all actions to implement the president’s immigration order. The department will resume inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the executive order, according to a DHS statement. Meanwhile, the State Department said it has reversed the cancellation of visas that were provisionally revoked following the travel ban—so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled. According to Customs and Border Protection, individuals who had their visas physically canceled as a result of the executive order will not need to reapply for a new visa. Absent any other admissibility issues, those individuals will receive an I-193 waiver (Application for Waiver of Passport and/or Visa) upon arrival to the U.S. For those traveling by air, airlines have been instructed to contact Customs and Border Protection to receive authorization to permit boarding. On Sunday, Feb. 5, a federal appeals court rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore the executive order. We continue to monitor all legal and implementation decisions related to the executive order and will provide information as it becomes available. February 1, 2017 – Travel Alert Under President Trump’s Immigration Executive Order On January 27, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order suspending immigrant and non-immigrant admissions to the U.S. for at least 90 days for individuals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The Executive Order did not specifically categorize what categories of “individuals” (i.e., the definition of “ individuals from ”) are subject to the ban. This broad generalization has led to widespread confusion at ports of entry across the U.S., but since then the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has stated that travelers will be treated according to the travel document (passport) they present at the border. See https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/29/protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states Federal judges in several jurisdictions issued court rulings to stay the terms of the Executive Order that would have led to the removal of foreign nationals who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa or status as a lawful permanent resident (green card holder). These stays remain in effect but may be temporary. These court orders also do not apply to airports with pre-clearance facilities (Dublin & Shannon, Ireland; Aruba; Freeport & Nassau, The Bahamas; Bermuda; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and Calgary, Toronto, Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver, and Winnipeg, Canada). Nationals of the seven affected countries should avoid flying into the U.S. from these airports. These court orders do not mean that anyone arriving with a visa is guaranteed entry. People with a non-immigrant (temporary) visa from those 7 countries will be denied entry unless they can show that their admission is in the national interest and they do not pose a security threat. Citizens of the affected countries who hold dual citizenship with the U.S. should not be directly affected. Non-U.S. citizens who hold dual citizenship with the affected countries and one other foreign country may be subject to the ban. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant deemed a threat to national security or public safety. This ban may include individuals who have traveled to one or more of the designated countries as well, even if they do not hold a nationality of one of the designated countries. Additional screening for those who have been in these countries should be expected, including the search and examination of luggage, mobile phones, computers, and electronics, including social media pages for any anti-American communications or posts. Green card holders returning to the U.S. after a short time abroad have the legal right to return to the U.S., barring exceptional circumstances. On January 29, 2017, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security released a statement that “the entry of lawful permanent residents” is in the national interest. Further, U.S. Embassies and Consulates across the world have been instructed not to issue any non-immigrant or immigrant visas to persons from the affected countries, consistent with the Executive Order. Also, individuals from one of the affected countries who have a pending immigration petition or application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may experience delays in the adjudication of their cases. The Executive Order also contemplates that additional countries could be added to the banned list.  Accordingly, until more information becomes available, and given the possibility of a change in government policy that could go into effect immediately, all foreign nationals should carefully assess whether it is worth the risk to travel outside the United States. We recommend that international students and scholars should not travel outside of the U.S. without speaking with an advisor at the Office of Global Services (OGS) and/or seeking advice from personal legal counsel who can review individual circumstances for potential available options or possible relief from the consequences of the Executive Order. The OGS can provide you with a list of personal immigration attorneys and a list of pro bono service providers. The OGS is working with offices and key stakeholders throughout the university to offer resources and support for international students and scholars. Joseph Aoun, President of Northeastern University, sent a message to the entire Northeastern community on January 28, 2017, stating: “Let us strengthen our resolve to be a welcoming community that embraces the immeasurable benefits of diversity and inclusion. All in our community—especially those who feel vulnerable as a result of this new paradigm—should feel safe and secure at Northeastern. We, the leadership of the university, stand with you and will pursue every means available to safeguard each of you—students, faculty, and staff.” This alert is not legal advice. We will continue to provide updated information and guidance as it becomes available."

These definitions align with the Northeastern University’s defined instructional methods. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In person (Traditional): All engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Hybrid: The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Remote (Online): The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer’s physical location Per federal regulations, F-1 international students must maintain on-ground presence during every required academic term of study to maintain nonimmigrant student status. This includes any required term when a student is engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization. With these defined methods, the Office of Global Services (OGS) has updated the maintenance of status policy for F-1 students engaging in remote practical experiences. Starting Fall 2024, during required academic terms, F-1 students engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning while authorized for CPT must maintain their non-immigrant status with on-ground presence by either: Engaging on-site (in person) at the designated employer’s location. This can be in-person or hybrid, as defined above. Engaging remotely with the designated employer with simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course. Students should enroll in an on-ground course stipulated by their academic program, which must run for the duration of the required academic term. Students should work with their academic department/advisor to identify a course that is appropriate. Co-op students only : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements. If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor. If an F-1 student withdraws from (W grade) or fails to attend (NE grade) their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training/experiential learning, it will be a violation of status based on failure to maintain on-ground presence . The student’s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated which may impact eligibility for other F-1 benefits, including but not limited to Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (Post-OPT). F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above.

        "content": "USCIS Removes Conflicting Interpretation of the Five-Month Temporary Absence Rule Last Updated December 3, 2024 On November 26, 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) re-published its Policy Manual to remove the conflicting guidance issued on August 27, 2024, regarding the Five-Month Temporary Absence Rule for F-1 students. The USCIS update resolves the confusion created by the August policy update and aligns with the Student and Exchange Visitor Program’s (SEVP) longstanding guidance allowing exceptions to the five-month rule for F-1 students participating in authorized study abroad programs. Therefore, students may continue to engage in a temporary absence abroad that exceeds 5 months if it is an approved academic activity and it is reported to the Office of Global Services (OGS). Approved academic activities abroad for F-1 students include study abroad, global co-op, or research abroad. Northeastern University and other institutions, alongside professional international education organizations, advocated for clarity and alignment of federal guidance. We are pleased to see this positive resolution and will continue to monitor related developments. If you have questions about your F-1 status or upcoming plans to return to the U.S. after an absence of more than five months, please contact OGS for guidance and support. Original October 8, 2024 Alert Federal regulations state that students in F-1 status maintain nonimmigrant status as long as they return to the U.S. after a temporary absence of five months or less [8 CFR 214.2(f)(4)]. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) allows an exception to the 5-month rule for F-1 students enrolled in an authorized study abroad program. On August 27, 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a Policy Alert announcing a new interpretation of the Five-Month Temporary Absence Rule for F-1 students. The USCIS alert has created confusion as it conflicts with the SEVP’s long-standing agency guidance. Professional international education organizations and institutes of higher education, including Northeastern University, are actively engaged in advocacy efforts to seek clarification in support of F-1 students enrolled in approved academic activities abroad. In the interim, if you are a Northeastern student who has been outside of the U.S. for more than five months due to study abroad, global co-op, or research abroad, please contact OGS ( Contact – Office of Global Services ) to request a letter of support for re-entry into the U.S. as a proactive measure.

What is a Non-Medical Leave of Absence? A Non-Medical Leave of Absence (NMLOA) refers to time during which a student interrupts their studies and departs the U.S. for personal reasons. An Emergency Leave (authorized by WeCare) is also considered a NMLOA. All students who take a leave of absence of any kind are responsible for reviewing and understanding institutional policies regarding withdrawing from courses in the Northeastern Course Catalog. Students must also follow all of their college/graduate school processes and notify the OGS prior to beginning their leave of absence. Depending on the length of a NMLOA, a student’s eligibility for employment authorization (Curricular Practical Training/Optional Practical Training/Academic Training) may be affected, so it is important to schedule an appointment with an Designated School Official or DSO (F-1 students) or an Alternate Responsible Officer or ARO (J-1 students) to discuss your circumstances. How to Request a Non-Medical Leave of Absence Students must complete ALL of the following steps. Please note that steps 2 and 3 should be completed simultaneously. 1 Do not drop or withdraw from your classes prior to OGS confirming your eligibility! All F/J students must continue to maintain full time enrollment with appropriate on-ground presence until they have been authorized by a DSO or ARO to drop below full-time enrollment requirements. 2 Schedule an appointment with an OGS Advisor and complete OGS' NMLOA e-form All students seeking a NMLOA should make an appointment with a DSO/ARO in OGS to discuss how the leave will impact their SEVIS status and future eligibility for SEVIS benefits, such as Curricular Practical Training (CPT), Optional Practical Training (OPT), Academic Training (AT), etc. Students must also complete OGS’ NMLOA e-form and should do this as early as possible. Students will be asked to add their advisor or secondary approver email to the e-form as a secondary approver. To schedule an appointment with a DSO or ARO, please call +1-617-373-2310 or visit our front desk on the Boston campus at 354 Richards Hall. 3 Submit a personal leave request via the Registrar Forms link in the Student Hub Students must make official arrangements for taking a leave of absence by submitting a leave request in the Student Hub. To learn more about the process for submitting the request in the Student Hub, review the Registrar’s knowledge-article on leaves of absence. Students should also communicate and make arrangements with their academic advisor or graduate school office. 4 Depart the U.S. Students must depart the U.S. for the duration of their NMLOA. You will be advised by a DSO/ARO in OGS about the timeline for departure that you must follow. How to Return from a NMLOA? Once you are ready to resume your studies at Northeastern University, you can review OGS’ instructions on Returning from a Leave of Absence. Key Resources Notification to OGS of Non-Medical Leave of Absence » This is to submit a request for a non-medical leave of absence. Re-entry I-20 Request » For students returning from leave and not eligible for reactivation, academic dismissal, or after a status violation. Return from Leave of Absence Less Than 5 Months » This is to request a new I-20 to resume classes after a leave of absence of less than 5 months Related Articles: Medical Leave Of Absence Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × Can I stay in the U.S. if I take a non-medical leave of absence? No. U.S. federal regulations require that all students taking a non-medical leave of absence spend the duration of their absence outside of the U.S. If I stop attending classes before I notify OGS about my non-medical leave of absence, what will happen to my SEVIS record? If you stop attending, drop, or withdraw from classes before notifying OGS, your SEVIS record will be terminated for unauthorized withdrawal. You will have to depart the U.S. immediately and will need to request a new Initial I-20 in order to return to your studies (you will not be eligible for Reactivation). When you return to the U.S. with a new Initial I-20, your F-1 status will begin again, and your eligibility clock for F-1/J-1 employment benefits (CPT/OPT/AT) will be reset. What are the criteria for being eligible for “Reactivation” of my Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record? Please review the “ Returning from a Leave of Absence ” page to see if you meet the criteria. I am trying to decide whether a medical leave or non-medical leave would best fit my situation. How can I decide? Please read the information regarding medical and non-medical leaves on our website. You will see that there are different federal regulations for each of these leaves. Then, make an appointment with a DSO/ARO in OGS to discuss your plans and available options.",

What should they keep in mind? Members of our international and immigrant community based at a U.S. campus should continue to be proactive about travel plans and prepare for the possibility of sudden change. Any citizens of a country that was subject to a travel ban in the past may want to be particularly cautious about international travel in the coming months.

International students, faculty, and staff who are not citizens of a country subject to a past travel ban, and who have a valid U.S. visa, face fewer risks when traveling internationally. Still, all international travelers should expect additional screening by U.S. immigration when you return from abroad.

For travel within the U.S., including its territories such as Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam, you do not need an updated travel signature. How can I renew my student visa? Should your visa expire before you return to the U.S. from a visit abroad, you will need to reapply for the F-1 or J-1 visa abroad. The process is the same as when you obtained your original student visa. Refer to the Renewing your Visa page . How can I renew my passport? Contact or check the website of your country’s nearest embassy or consulate in the U.S. to learn about the process for renewing your passport. I will renew my passport but my student visa is still valid and is in my old passport. What should I do? When you travel, carry both the new passport and the old passport that contains your student visa if your country of citizenship allows you to keep your old passport. If your country does not allow you to keep your old passport that contains the valid F-1 or J-1 visa, you will need to apply for a new visa the next time you travel abroad.",

        "title": "Renewing your Visa - Office of Global Services",
        "content": "Students Studying in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe United States Renewing your Visa Depending on the length of your academic program and duration of your visa, the F-1/J-1 visa in your passport may expire during your program at Northeastern University. An expired visa has no impact on your legal status in the U.S. and is not needed to complete your NU degree. If your F-1/J-1 visa expires, you will only need to renew the visa if you decide to travel internationally during the remainder of your academic program and/or the duration of your OPT/STEM Extension or Academic Training. Please see below for guidance on the visa renewal process, understanding that visa renewal is discretionary and does carry risk of delay or denial. Visa Expiration The F-1/J-1 visa in your passport is an entry document – it must be valid on the day that you are attempting to enter the U.S. You are allowed to remain in the U.S. after the F-1/J-1 visa expires, as long as you are actively maintaining your F-1/J-1 status and have a valid I-20/DS-2019. For example, if you are approved for an I-20/DS-2019 program extension, but your F-1/J-1 visa has expired, you are eligible to remain in the U.S. with the valid I-20/DS-2019. Because the F-1/J-1 visa does not determine your eligibility to remain in the U.S., once you have arrived in the U.S., it is not needed to continue and complete your program of study. As such, it is not recommended that you travel for the sole purpose of renewing your F-1 /J-1 v isa as delays could impact academic progress if you are unable to return to campus to resume on-ground, full-time enrollment. Visa Renewal Location You cannot renew your F-1/J-1 visa from within the U.S.  You can only renew your F-1/J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate outside the U.S. You can find a list of U.S. Embassies/Consulates abroad here . If you decide to travel internationally and need to renew your visa, OGS recommends that you do so at the U.S. Embassy/Consulate in your country of citizenship when possible. However, you might be eligible to apply to renew your F-1/J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate outside of your country of citizenship. If you apply for an F-1/J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate that is not in your home country, you are called a Third Country National (3CN) visa applicant. Check with the U.S. Embassy/Consulate in the third country to see if they will accept Third Country National visa applicants. If you decide to renew your F-1/J-1 visa in a country other than your country of citizenship, OGS strongly recommends that you plan ahead as visa issuance is always discretionary. Current students are also advised to establish a back up plan in the event that they are unable to return to the U.S. in a timely manner to participate in courses/practical training/research in person. This may include taking a leave of absence, as F-1/J-1 students are not able to maintain legal status if they are participating in their program in a fully remote capacity. Please also remember to always register your international travel during your academic program with the Global Safety Office Travel Registry . Visa Renewal Process The process of renewing your visa is similar to the initial visa application process you completed before arrival. As the process and requirements may vary from one Embassy to another, you will need to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the country of application for detailed application questions. For more details about the visa application process, please review the \"F-1 Student Visa Process\" or \"J-1 Student Visa Process\" page under the \"Current Students\" section of the OGS website. Important Note about Visa Renewals Please note that receiving an initial F-1/J-1 visa does not guarantee that your visa will be renewed in the future. Each visa application is reviewed independently, and renewal decisions are based on the standards in place at the time of application. It is important to stay informed about any changes to visa adjudication policies, especially as standards may evolve under different administrations. Recommended Documents for Current Students Seeking a Visa Renewal Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application Form ( DS-160 ) confirmation page Visa application fee payment receipt (visit the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate website for specific instructions) Original Form I-20 (F-1 students) or DS-2019 (J-1 students) with valid travel signature issued by OGS Valid passport (should be valid for at least six months after your planned date of re-entry to the U.S.) Evidence of financial support (proof of sufficient funds for estimated cost of living and tuition for one academic year) I-901 fee payment receipt A copy of your acceptance letter to Northeastern University One photograph ( see the U.S. Department of State website for photo requirements ) Enrollment Verification (recommended only for current students) Additional Documents for F-1 Students on Post-OPT/STEM Extension Valid Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Proof of Employment (offer letter, pay stub, letter from employer, etc.) Additional Documents for J-1 Students on Academic Training ARO Letter Authorizing Academic Training (from OGS) Visa Application Outcomes Please note that if you are a current student and your attempt to renew your visa prevents you from returning to the U.S. to resume classes, you may be advised to seek a leave of absence. Approval Congratulations! The majority of F-1/J-1 visa renewal applications are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you. Denials 214(b) Denial Although F-1/J-1 visa denials are rare during visa renewal applications, the most common visa denial is under 214(b). This means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have nonimmigrant intent and/or did not fully show they have sufficient ties to their home country—such as family, job, education, or property—indicating they will not immigrate to the U.S. Students are expected to return home after completing their studies and any qualifying periods of Optional Practical Training (OPT) or Academic Training (AT). The F-1/J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer’s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your F-1/J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1/J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. PP 10043 Denial On May 29, 2020, a Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China’s “military-civil fusion strategy.” This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected. Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations. If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance. Students should review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials. Administrative Processing Please note that if you received a 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your initial visa application, it is probable that you will receive another 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your visa renewal application. We encourage students to consult with OGS directly if they have received a 221(g) notice in the past prior to departing the U.S. to attempt to renew their visa. The outcome of some visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as “ Administrative Processing .” Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months. In these cases, the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. You should follow the instructions listed on the 221(g) notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance. What is “Administrative Processing”? After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including: Your country of birth or citizenship Academic or employment history, including military experience Travel history Source of funding Past U.S. immigration records Family members’ backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence Geopolitical factors These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn’t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields. Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa. Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process. If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment. Next Steps During Administrative Processing If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process. Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing. Replacing a Lost or Stolen F-1/J-1 Visa It is recommended that F-1/J-1 students make photocopies of all their immigration documents (including passport and F-1/J-1 visa). If your passport containing the F-1/J-1 visa is lost or stolen, please file a police report immediately by either going to a local police station or contacting NUPD . You should then report your passport/visa lost or stolen to the local Embassy/Consular section of your country of citizenship in the U.S., requesting a new passport (if you have no other valid passport) and to the U.S. Embassy/Consular section which issued your F-1/J-1 visa originally. It is not possible to replace a lost or stolen F-1/J-1 visa in the U.S. However, if you still have a valid passport or have submitted a request to replace your passport, and you have a valid I-20/DS-2019, you may remain in the U.S. even with the lost F-1/J-1 visa. If you travel internationally, you will need to renew the F-1/J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad to return to the U.S. When applying for the replacement visa, you will need to provide a copy of the police report and written documentation about the loss of your passport and visa. Please see the U.S. Department of State website for more guidance. Travel to Canada, Mexico, or U.S. Adjacent Islands If you travel to Canada, Mexico, or one of the islands adjacent to the U.S. (other than Cuba) for less than thirty days with your valid passport, a valid form I-20 or form DS-2019, and your most recent form I-94 , you may be eligible to travel with an expired F or J visa. This process is known as automatic visa revalidation . However, you must meet certain conditions in order to be eligible for automatic visa revalidation. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for more information on eligibility.

                "section_content": "Visa Application Outcomes Please note that if you are a current student and your attempt to renew your visa prevents you from returning to the U.S. to resume classes, you may be advised to seek a leave of absence. Approval Congratulations! The majority of F-1/J-1 visa renewal applications are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you. Denials 214(b) Denial Although F-1/J-1 visa denials are rare during visa renewal applications, the most common visa denial is under 214(b). This means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have nonimmigrant intent and/or did not fully show they have sufficient ties to their home country—such as family, job, education, or property—indicating they will not immigrate to the U.S. Students are expected to return home after completing their studies and any qualifying periods of Optional Practical Training (OPT) or Academic Training (AT). The F-1/J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer’s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your F-1/J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1/J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. PP 10043 Denial On May 29, 2020, a Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China’s “military-civil fusion strategy.” This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected. Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations. If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance. Students should review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials. Administrative Processing Please note that if you received a 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your initial visa application, it is probable that you will receive another 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your visa renewal application. We encourage students to consult with OGS directly if they have received a 221(g) notice in the past prior to departing the U.S. to attempt to renew their visa. The outcome of some visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as “ Administrative Processing .” Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months. In these cases, the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. You should follow the instructions listed on the 221(g) notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance. What is “Administrative Processing”? After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including: Your country of birth or citizenship Academic or employment history, including military experience Travel history Source of funding Past U.S. immigration records Family members’ backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence Geopolitical factors These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn’t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields. Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa. Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process. If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment. Next Steps During Administrative Processing If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process. Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing."

If your passport containing the F-1/J-1 visa is lost or stolen, please file a police report immediately by either going to a local police station or contacting NUPD . You should then report your passport/visa lost or stolen to the local Embassy/Consular section of your country of citizenship in the U.S., requesting a new passport (if you have no other valid passport) and to the U.S. Embassy/Consular section which issued your F-1/J-1 visa originally. It is not possible to replace a lost or stolen F-1/J-1 visa in the U.S. However, if you still have a valid passport or have submitted a request to replace your passport, and you have a valid I-20/DS-2019, you may remain in the U.S. even with the lost F-1/J-1 visa. If you travel internationally, you will need to renew the F-1/J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad to return to the U.S. When applying for the replacement visa, you will need to provide a copy of the police report and written documentation about the loss of your passport and visa.

A travel signature is an endorsement on your I-20 or DS 2019, given by a Designated School Official (DSO) or Alternative Responsible Officer (ARO), after screening your immigration record and academic enrollment to verify lawful status. If you are on an F-1 visa, this is the signature at the bottom of page 2 of your current I-20. If you are on a J-1 visa, this is on the bottom right of your DS-2019. How long is my travel signature valid? For current F/J Students and Scholars, an I-20 travel signature and DS-2019 travel endorsement are valid for 12-months (or until the document’s expiration date, whichever is sooner). For those on J-1 Academic Training or F-1 Post-Completion OPT/STEM Extension require a new travel signature every 6-months. To request a travel signature, please submit the travel signature e-form request. Prior to major vacation periods, OGS often offers travel signature sessions that require pre-registration.  After successful screening, you will receive your travel signature on the spot. If you wish attend a session, please bring your I-20/DS-2019 form and your nine-digit Northeastern identification number. Visit the events page for travel signature session dates. Travel Tips If you have completed OPT, Academic Training (AT), or your academic program, and are in a grace period, you will not be allowed back into the U.S. on your F-1 or J-1 visa. Any family members traveling with you who have F-2 or J-2 visas will also need to carry the same documents. Please review the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) tips for travel .

Related Articles: Renewing your Visa Executive Orders Navigate this Page: Frequently Asked Questions » Frequently Asked Questions × Do I need a travel signature? If you are traveling within the U.S., you do not need a travel signature. If you are traveling outside of the U.S., you do need a travel signature. If you have completed one academic program and plan to start another the following semester/quarter and you have the I-20 or DS-2019 for your new program, then you may travel without getting a travel signature on the I-20 or DS-2019 for your new program. How can I renew my passport? Contact or check the website of your country’s nearest embassy or consulate in the U.S. to learn about the process for renewing your passport. I will renew my passport but my student visa is still valid and is in my old passport. What should I do? When you travel, carry both the new passport and the old passport with your student visa if your country of nationality allows you to keep your old passport. If your country does not allow you to keep your old passport containing a valid F-1 or J-1 visa, you will need to apply for a new visa the next time you travel abroad. I need to return home during a required term. How long can I be outside of the U.S.? A huge part of your responsibility of maintaining your F-1/J-1 status is by actively participating in classes in person. This includes students who are engaging in practical training (co-op, internships, clinical rotations, etc.). All students must also adhere to their college’s attendance and absenteeism policy. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1/J-1 student be absent from their courses for an extended period during the academic term. As an international student, this prolonged absence may impact your F-1/J-1 status and your long-term academic goals . If you are unable to attend your classes in person, you may be advised to pursue a leave of absence from your studies.",

In rare situations, a student may request a second Final Term RCL if they were unable to complete their degree requirements in the final term. This is usually limited to students who received a failing grade for a required course in their final term. No more than two consecutive Final Term RCL approvals may be granted. If you need to request a second Final Term RCL, please contact OGS to schedule an appointment with a Designated School Official (DSO). All students in their final term must notify OGS by submitting the Intent to Complete Program form within 30 days after the start of their final term. This e-form alerts OGS to shorten a student’s I-20/DS-2019 if your end date occurs in a future term. Remember, your I-20/DS-2019 end date must correspond with your final term of enrollment.

If you depart the U.S. after the program end date on the I-20 for your previous degree program, you will need to wait until you receive the new CDL I-20 for your new degree program to enter the U.S. As your SEVIS ID and school name on your CDL I-20 as your previous I-20, your previously issued F-1 visa should remain valid for travel as long as it has not expired. Employment and Change of Degree Level On-Campus Employment You may continue any on-campus employment during the time between degree levels only if you have received the Change of Degree level I-20 . OPT & STEM OPT Employment Once your change of degree level I-20 is processed, you will no longer be eligible to apply for Post-Completion OPT b ased on the previous degree.

        "content": "Students Studying in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe United States Guidelines on Maintaining Status While it is your responsibility to maintain your status, the Office of Global Services is here to help guide you through the complexities of the U.S. government regulations and procedures. The goal of the Office of Global Services (OGS) is to support you in achieving your personal, academic, and professional goals during your time in the U.S. As an international student with F-1 or J-1 nonimmigrant student status, in addition to the challenges of attending a degree program in a foreign country and navigating intercultural differences, you have the added responsibility of maintaining your F-1 or J-1 student status to remain in the U.S. and successfully complete your degree. Maintaining Lawful F-1/J-1 Status As an F-1 or J-1 student, you must meet certain obligations in order to maintain lawful nonimmigrant status. Maintaining status is necessary in order to retain eligibility for the benefits of F-1 or J-1 status , such as employment authorization and program extension, and can be crucial to a successful application for a change or adjustment of nonimmigrant status in the future. Failure to maintain your nonimmigrant status can result in serious problems with immigration and could lead to deportation from the U.S. F-1 Students : Please also review the information provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the Study in the States website regarding maintaining F-1 status. Please be sure to click each section and item below and carefully read the information. Contact OGS if you have questions about these requirements. Consequences of Not Maintaining Your Status If you fail to maintain your F-1/J-1 status, your legal permission to remain in the U.S., utilize the F-1 or J-1 status benefits, such as practical training and employment, as well as your ability to return to the U.S. in the future, may be impacted. This also applies to your accompanying F-2/J-2 dependents' status.  \r\n\r\nIf you think you may have violated your visa status, please immediately contact OGS, who will schedule an appointment with you to discuss your situation and your options. The options for regaining F-1 status after a status violation are outlined on the OGS website. F-1 and J-1 Student General Requirements (Click each topic below for more information) Immediately open and carefully read any emails you receive from [email protected] (the Office of Global Services email). Our office will send any important information related to your F-1/J-1 status to your Northeastern email address . Please add the OGS email address to your approved senders list in your Northeastern email account and frequently check your junk/spam folders for any missed emails from OGS. Failure to read an important email from OGS will not be an acceptable excuse to the Department of Homeland Security for failing to maintain your F-1/J-1 status . Report Any U.S. Address or Phone Number Changes F-1 and J-1 regulations require that you report any change to your U.S. phone number or U.S. local address within 10 days of the change . OGS is then required to report this change on your behalf in your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record. These changes are not reflected on your I-20/DS-2019 and do not require issuance of a new document. Currently enrolled students should update this information in their Student Hub account. Graduated students on post-completion OPT, STEM OPT, or AT should report their address update either in the SEVP portal or in myOGS. Keep Copies of all Immigration-Related Documents (I-20s, DS-2019s, etc.) OGS does not retain signed copies of your immigration documents, as it is your responsibility to maintain a record of these documents. Save each immigration document you are issued during your F-1/J-1 status. You may need them in the future: to document your employment history and your compliance with U.S. immigration regulations for applications for immigration benefits to U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) or future visa applications to Department of State For electronically issued I-20s, you must print and sign at the bottom of Page 1. We recommend you take a photo or scan a PDF of the signed document. Students on the STEM OPT Extension : please keep copies of all fully executed Forms I-983 that you complete with your STEM employers (including all 12-month and final evaluations on Page 5). J-1 students : please print and sign each digitally-signed DS-2019 that is issued to you. We recommend you keep copies of all DS-2019s issued to you either as paper documents or digitally-signed documents. Report Changes to Your Immigration Status Report any changes in your non-immigrant status from F-1/J-1 to any other status to OGS. You can report a change to becoming a permanent resident (green card holder) using this e-form . If your non-immigrant status changes to H-1B, you can submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form . Attend the School Listed on Page 1 of your Form I-20 (F-1 Students) or DS-2019 (J-1 Students) Submit the Mandatory Immigration Clearance Immediately Upon Arrival in the U.S. at the Start of your Program All international students with F-1 or J-1 status must complete the mandatory Immigration Clearance at the start of each new program of study. This is a U.S. government regulation for students to maintain their non-immigrant status. OGS facilitates this process, which is called “online immigration clearance.” Students who do not complete the mandatory immigration clearance within the deadline are not maintaining status and are at risk of SEVIS record termination. Students will receive emails regarding Immigration Clearance before the start of their academic program and can find more information regarding this process on the OGS website . Keep Your Immigration Documents Accurate and Up to Date Keep your passport valid at all times. The passport must be valid for at least 6 months into the future on the day you return to the U.S. from a trip abroad. Your F-1/J-1 visa may expire while you are inside the U.S. You only need to renew your F-1/J-1 visa if you are going to travel outside of the U.S. and need to return. Keep your I-20 or DS-2019 valid and accurate at all times and understand your end date. Remember that your I-20/DS-2019 is essentially a printout of your SEVIS record, and if things change, you must notify OGS so that the document can be updated . Extend your I-20 prior to its expiration date if you are unable to complete your academic program by the original end date. In the event of change of academic program or level, update your I-20 in a timely fashion in accordance with immigration regulations (see the “Change of Degree Level” section below) Notify OGS if you decide to finish your degree online from overseas, stop your program earlier than anticipated , or end an authorized period of CPT/OPT/STEM OPT earlier than anticipated and depart the U.S. Understand Your “Grace Period” After Program Completion F-1 and J-1 students enter what is called a “grace period” after they have completed their degree programs. This usually aligns with your I-20/DS-2019 program end date, or after you have completed all degree requirements, whichever is sooner. If you finish degree requirements before your I-20/DS-2019 end date, you must notify OGS so that your document can be updated, as your grace period and eligibility for certain benefits are based on your program completion. During the grace period, students can remain in the U.S. to travel or prepare to depart the U.S. Any on-campus employment must stop as of the I-20/DS-2019 program end date. F-1 Students : F-1 students who successfully complete their program are granted a 60-day grace period starting the day after their I-20 program end date. During the 60-day grace period, F-1 students are eligible for the following: To remain in the U.S. for traveling and preparing to depart the U.S. To request a change of degree level. To apply for post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT). To request a transfer if admitted to another SEVP-certified institution. During the 60-day grace period, F-1 students are NOT eligible for the following: Program extension: if you have remaining degree requirements after your I-20 program end date, you must request extension before the end date. J-1 Students : J-1 students who successfully complete their program are granted a 30-day grace period starting the day after their DS-2019 program end date. During the 30-day grace period, J-1 students are only eligible for the following: To remain in the U.S. for traveling and preparing to depart the U.S. During the 30-day grace period, J-1 students are NOT eligible for the following: To request to transfer to another U.S. institution. To apply for post-completion Academic Training (AT) – this must be requested prior to your DS-2019 end date. To request to begin a new degree program at Northeastern while remaining in the U.S. through “matriculation.” If you have not requested OPT/AT, a change of degree level, or received approval to transfer out, and you depart the U.S. during the grace period, your SEVIS record will be completed and you are no longer eligible to re-enter on your current I-20 or DS-2019. F-1 and J-1 Study Requirements (Click each topic below for more information) Make Normal Academic Progress and Stay in Good Academic Standing Review the academic requirements, academic policies, and minimum GPA requirements of your academic program and adhere to all requirements. Failure to maintain normal academic progress and academic standing may result in academic probation, dismissal, suspension or other negative consequences which may impact your ability to maintain full-time enrollment and your F-1/J-1 status. If you are academically dismissed, please review the OGS website and contact OGS as soon as possible to discuss your options. Please be sure to reach out for academic support early and often if you are experiencing challenges with coursework. Maintain Full-Time Enrollment You must maintain full-time enrollment each academic term (except during designated vacation periods) and make continuous academic progress towards the completion of your program of study. Full-time enrollment is as follows: Undergraduate: minimum of 12 credit hours per term Graduate: minimum of 8 credit hours per term (9 credit hours per term in a 3-credit enrollment system) Graduate students who hold an assistantship: minimum of 6 credit hours per term International students enrolled in NU Immerse/Global Pathways must follow the requirements of their programs Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS) The same rules regarding maintaining full-time enrollment, as explained above, apply to F-1 students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS), but there are important differences in program delivery. Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in two sessions (A and B) but still count as one full academic term. CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on-ground courses throughout the entire term. For instance, F-1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term. F-1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility! Maintain On-Ground Presence in Classes Students must maintain on-ground presence throughout the academic term. At Northeastern, there are four different defined instructional methods: Traditional, Hybrid, Live Cast, and Online. Traditional, Hybrid, and Live Cast courses meet the F-1 on-ground presence requirements. Online courses do not meet the F-1 on-ground presence requirements. You can learn more about the Defined Instructional Methods at Northeastern on the Registrar’s website. Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS) Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in one of two sessions (A and B) throughout the academic term. CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on-ground courses throughout the entire term. For instance, F-1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term. F-1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility! Maintain On-Ground Presence when Authorized for Curricular Practical Training (F-1 students) F-1 students must maintain on-ground presence while pursuing practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) Authorization. On-ground presence is a key component and requirement of F-1 nonimmigrant status and must be maintained during all required terms. Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during vacation periods. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In Person (Traditional) : All engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Hybrid : The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Remote (Online) : The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer’s physical location To learn more about maintaining on-ground presence when authorized for CPT, please visit this webpage. Understand Limitations to Enrolling in Online Courses F-1 students have strict limitations to online course enrollment imposed by the U.S. federal government. In general, within minimum full-time credit requirements , F-1 students may be eligible to take a maximum of: one 3-credit online course, or one 4-credit online course in a 4-credit enrollment system or up to three credits total for 1-credit courses, for example, three 1-credit courses, or one 2-credit course and one 1-credit course Enrolling in two 2-credit online courses is not acceptable and considered a violation of F-1 status Students in NU Immerse/Global Pathways are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements Once F-1 students have met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements, they may enroll in additional online courses if needed/desired. J-1 students are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements. It is important that all F-1 and J-1 students contact their academic advisor before enrolling in online courses or withdrawing from any courses, so that they can make an informed decision about their enrollment. Understand Limitations on Reduced Course Loads With minor exceptions for non-required summer terms and your final term , you must maintain full-time enrollment and should not drop below a full-time course load unless you have received authorization from OGS in advance. You are not eligible for a reduced course load or a non-medical leave of absence without receiving prior authorization from OGS. Authorization must be obtained before the start of the term or before dropping any course(s) that would drop below full-time enrollment. Please see sections on reduced course load and leaves of absence for more information on these topics. Request a Leave of Absence in Advance If you need to take a Medical Leave of Absence or a Personal Leave of Absence , you must submit requests to both the University and OGS in advance . Do not drop or withdraw from your classes without final approval from OGS. There is no retroactive leave of absence authorization for students who drop classes without being approved for a leave. Follow Requirements for Study Abroad, Global Co-op, and Research Abroad Study Abroad and Global Co-op : If you are participating in a university-approved study abroad experience through the Global Experience Office or a university-approved Global Co-op, you must report your academic activities abroad to OGS. You are required to maintain full-time enrollment in order to maintain your F-1/J-1 student status while participating in approved academic activities abroad. Any changes in enrollment during your program could affect your ability to return to the U.S . Research Abroad : To be approved by OGS for research abroad, you must maintain your full-time registration status at Northeastern University. Additionally, your overseas research project must be required to complete your degree . Please refer to the Study Abroad, Research Abroad, and Global Co-op page of the OGS website for more information. Notify OGS of Any Change in Program or Degree Level in Advance If you are a current, continuing student at Northeastern and you will be starting a new program at Northeastern, you must submit a Change of Degree Level (CDL) e-form to OGS prior to starting the new program . This does not apply to undergraduate students who are changing majors. Please review OGS’ CDL webpage for more information and instructions: Change of Degree Level – officeofglobalservices (northeastern.edu) Notify OGS of Any Change of Major in Advance If you are a current, continuing undergraduate student at Northeastern and you will be 1) changing your major or 2) declaring your major, you must submit a I-20 of DS-2019 Request for Continuing Students e-form to OGS prior to starting the new program . This applies to students in the Explore Program and the General Studies Program. Once your request is reviewed and processed by OGS, you will receive a new I-20 with the same SEVIS ID number reflecting the new program information. You will not be required to submit an Immigration Clearance again for this new degree. If you are currently in a Master’s program and you are c hanging from one Master’s degree program to another Master’s degree program (either after completing the first, or without completing), please see Change of Degree Level information above. Transferring to Another U.S. School If you are an F-1 student who would like to transfer your SEVIS record from Northeastern University to another SEVP-certified institution, you should review the Transferring Out page of the OGS website and must submit a transfer out request to OGS so that we can release your SEVIS record. To have your SEVIS record transferred to your new institution, you must continue to maintain your F-1 student status until the transfer release date. You may request that our office transfer your SEVIS record prior to the end of your program at Northeastern, but the date that your new university receives your record should occur after you have completed your program or after your last date of attendance. If you have already completed your program, your transfer out date must occur within your 60-day grace period. Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree/Program Early F-1 students in their final term (even if it is earlier than their current I-20 end date) should review the Final Term page of the OGS website and submit the Intent to Complete e-form linked on that page. Your I-20/DS-2019 end date must correspond with your final term of enrollment. Therefore, if you will finish your program before your I-20/DS-2019 end date you must notify OGS so we can shorten your I-20/DS-2019 to reflect the term in which you completed all requirements for graduation. Remaining in the U.S. without full-time enrollment or taking other action to maintain/extend status even if your I-20/DS-2019 has an end date in the future is not considered maintaining status. If you are in your final term and are planning on applying for post-completion OPT or AT, your program end date will be adjusted accordingly if needed when OGS processes your request. Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree/Program Later Than Expected If you need additional time to complete your degree requirements, beyond your current I-20 or DS-2019 end date, you must apply for a Program Extension. To maintain your status, you must apply for this extension before your current I-20 or DS-2019 program end date . You can find more information about the Program Extension process on the OGS website. Intentionally failing classes to extend your I-20/DS-2019 is not a legitimate reason for a program extension and may be a violation of academic integrity policies which may impact your F-1/J-1 status. J-1 Student Requirements Please note that the requirements below are specific to students with J-1 status, who were issued a Form DS-2019. (Click each topic below for more information) Understand J-1 Student Status The J-1 Exchange Visitor Program is administered by the U.S. Department of State and was created in 1961 to “…promote mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries by means of educational and cultural exchange […]”. Cultural and educational exchange are the primary purpose of this visa program. To learn more about the J Exchange Visitor Program, please read the U.S. Department of State’s Welcome Brochure or Bridge USA J-1 Student Page which summarizes many of your rights. You can find contact information for the U.S. Department of State below. Telephone: +1-(866)-283-9090 Email: [email protected] Maintain Full-Time Enrollment & On-Ground Presence If you are in the J-1 student degree category (bachelor’s, master’s, doctorate) and enrolled in a full-time degree program, the same requirements above in the “Study Requirements” section regarding full-time enrollment and maintaining on-ground presence apply to you. You may only count one online class towards your full-time enrollment requirement . Once you have met the full-time, on-ground enrollment requirement, you are eligible to take additional online classes that exceed your minimum credit requirements. Maintain Health Insurance Coverage U.S. government regulations [22 CFR § 62.14] require all J-1 students and J-2 dependents to obtain health insurance that meets the following requirements: Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness Payment for repatriation (preparation and transportation of remains to home country) in case of death in the amount of $25,000 Payment for medical evacuation (transportation to home country on advice of attending physician) in the amount of $50,000 A deductible amount not to exceed $500 per accident or illness Coverage of pre-existing conditions after a reasonable waiting period Payment by the insurance company of at least 75% of the costs of medical care (the patient must not be required to pay more than 25% of medical care costs) Continuous coverage for the duration of the program To comply with these regulations, health insurance policies must be underwritten by corporations having one of the following: A.M. Best rating of A- or above McGraw Hill Financial/Standard & Poor’s Claims- paying Ability rating of ‘A- or above Weiss Research, Inc. rating of ‘‘B+’’ or above Fitch Ratings, Inc. rating of ‘‘A-’’ or above Moody’s Investor Services rating of ‘‘A3’’ or above. Note: Insurance backed by the full faith and credit of the exchange visitor ‘s (J-1 scholar’s) government meets this requirement. If you purchased health insurance in your home country, please ensure that it covers all of the requirements listed above. OGS is not able to review individual plans to ensure they comply with these requirements. Please contact your health insurance provider to confirm your plan meets all requirements. The Northeastern Student Health Insurance Plan (NUSHP) meets the Department of State requirements. If your health insurance plan does not cover repatriation & medical evacuation, there are supplemental plans you can purchase to meet this requirement, including this plan offered by Gallagher Student Health & Special Risk. Willful non-compliance with this requirement would be a violation of your J-1 status and may result in termination of your SEVIS record. Matriculation & Changing Degree Level J- 1 degree -seeking students may be eligible to continue their program at a higher degree level through a process called “Matriculation.” This is only permissible to move t o ah higher degree level, for example – Bachelor ‘s to Master’s o r Master ’s to Doctorate/PhD. If you are in the J-1 n on-degree student category, you are not eligible for Matriculation as that would require a change of your J-1 category. Two-Year Home Residence Requirement (212e) Some J-1 are subject to the two-year home country physical presence requirement. It requires you to return home for at least two years after your exchange visitor program ends. You can check your visa stamp and consular-processed DS-2019 to see whether you are subject. Please read the OGS website for more information to understand this requirement and contact OGS if you have questions. 12- and 24-Month Bars The 12- and 24-month bars are different from the two-year home country residence requirement. The 12- and 24-month rule affects J-1 exchange visitors who have been in the U.S. inJ-1 status previously, and wish to return, using the J-1 Research Scholar. If you are in the J-1 degree student category and have a program length longer than 6 months, please note that you will automatically become subject to the 12-month bar. This will only impact your ability to return to the U.S. in the J-1 Research Scholar/Professor categories for 12 months (commonly used for Visiting Scholars/Researchers/Professors and Postdoctoral Fellows). Please review the OGS website for more information about the bars. F-1 and J-1 Student Employment Requirements Employment is a benefit of F-1/J-1 status that has specific requirements and restrictions. You should be aware of these requirements and work only with permission and within the limits of your authorization. Working in the U.S. without appropriate authorization is a serious violation of your status. (Click each topic below for more information) Limit on-campus employment to 20 hours per week during the academic year. Although F-1 student on-campus employment does not require a specific authorization from OGS unless you need a social security number letter, you must be aware of the restrictions on number of hours you can work during academic and vacation terms. J-1 student employment does require authorization in advance from OGS. Please read the on-campus employment pages for more information. Obtain proper work authorization in advance before engaging in ANY off-campus employment (including AT/CPT/OPT/STEM OPT). Do not engage in any off-campus work without appropriate authorization from OGS or USCIS (depending on the authorization type). Please review the off-campus employment and working after graduation sections of the OGS website for eligibility and requirements for these types of off-campus work authorizations. Ensure that any work authorization documents (a CPT I-20, OPT EAD, STEM OPT EAD, etc.) are active and have valid dates any time you are working off-campus. Submitting a request to OGS without receiving an approval does NOT grant you work authorization. Contact OGS before engaging in “volunteer opportunities” or unpaid internships The regulations surrounding what is considered a true “volunteering” opportunity are complex. Before accepting such opportunities, review the OGS website to determine if the opportunity meets the criteria established by the Department of Labor for true “volunteering,” and contact OGS with questions. F-1 and J-1 Student Travel Requirements (Click each topic below for more information) Enter the U.S. No More than 30 Days Before Your Program Starts New students with Initial status I-20/DS-2019 documents should enter the U.S. no earlier than 30 days prior to the program start date listed on Page 1 of their document. Transfer-In and Change of Degree Level students can enter more than 30 days before the start of their new degree program as long as they have the new I-20 for that degree program. Travel with Required Documents For travel within the U.S. , please see the Domestic Travel page of the OGS website. Although you would not be going through Customs & Border Protection (CBP) for domestic travel, we recommend you travel with your valid passport, valid I-20/DS-2019, and a printout of your I-94 record. For international travel outside the U.S., please carefully review the International Travel page of the OGS website for required and recommended documents. Keep Your Passport Valid At Least 6 Months into the Future You may be eligible to renew your passport by your home country’s consulate in New York, Boston, or DC. Find information about the nearest consulate here . Your passport must be valid for a minimum of six months into the future. Obtain a Travel Signature for International Travel Obtain a travel signature prior to traveling internationally. If you already have a travel signature, ensure it will be valid on the date your re-enter the U.S. Travel signatures are valid for up to 1 year, but are only valid for 6 months while on AT/OPT/STEM OPT after graduation. Please review the OGS website for more information about international travel. Do Not Enter the U.S. with a Terminated, Completed, Inactive/Deactivated/Invalidated, or Cancelled SEVIS Record You are only eligible to enter the U.S. in F-1 or J-1 status with a SEVIS record in the following statuses: Initial – prior to or at the start of your program Active – during your program while still enrolled or on active AT/OPT/STEM OPT after graduation The following SEVIS statuses would not permit you to enter the U.S., as they indicate your program has ended or you are not eligible to enter: Terminated – you are on an approved Leave of Absence outside the U.S. or violated your status resulting in termination. You will be informed by OGS if your SEVIS record is terminated. Completed – you either: A) completed your degree program and did not apply to transfer or for post-graduation employment (AT/OPT/STEM OPT). B) finished your period of OPT/STEM OPT including the 60-day grace period and did not request to transfer or change degree level. Inactive/Deactivated/Invalidated – your J-1 program ended or your F-1/J-1 record was transferred to another institution that now holds your SEVIS record. Cancelled – if you tell OGS you will not start your program or you defer your admission without requesting an I-20 deferral. In general, if you are currently enrolled in your program and maintaining status and have met all requirements, your record will be in Active status throughout your program. If you are unsure of your SEVIS status or concerned it may not be Active, you may contact OGS. Other Requirements (Click each topic below for more information) Follow Northeastern University’s Code of Student Conduct and All Applicable U.S. Laws and Regulations. Please refer to the Northeastern University Code of Student Conduct . Suspension, academic dismissal, enrollment withheld, expulsion, or other similar disciplinary action which prevents enrollment may have an adverse effect on your F-1 or J-1 status. Please see an OGS advisor for guidance in these situations. Maintain Health Insurance Coverage Massachusetts law requires that every full-time and part-time student enrolled in a certificate, diploma or degree-granting program of higher education must participate in their school’s Student Health Program or in a health benefit plan with comparable coverage. J-1 Students and their J-2 Dependents are required to maintain health insurance that meets the Department of State minimum requirements. Please see the J-1 section above for more information.

Please add the OGS email address to your approved senders list in your Northeastern email account and frequently check your junk/spam folders for any missed emails from OGS. Failure to read an important email from OGS will not be an acceptable excuse to the Department of Homeland Security for failing to maintain your F-1/J-1 status . Report Any U.S. Address or Phone Number Changes F-1 and J-1 regulations require that you report any change to your U.S. phone number or U.S. local address within 10 days of the change . OGS is then required to report this change on your behalf in your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record. These changes are not reflected on your I-20/DS-2019 and do not require issuance of a new document. Currently enrolled students should update this information in their Student Hub account. Graduated students on post-completion OPT, STEM OPT, or AT should report their address update either in the SEVP portal or in myOGS. Keep Copies of all Immigration-Related Documents (I-20s, DS-2019s, etc.) OGS does not retain signed copies of your immigration documents, as it is your responsibility to maintain a record of these documents. Save each immigration document you are issued during your F-1/J-1 status. You may need them in the future: to document your employment history and your compliance with U.S. immigration regulations for applications for immigration benefits to U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) or future visa applications to Department of State For electronically issued I-20s, you must print and sign at the bottom of Page 1. We recommend you take a photo or scan a PDF of the signed document. Students on the STEM OPT Extension : please keep copies of all fully executed Forms I-983 that you complete with your STEM employers (including all 12-month and final evaluations on Page 5). J-1 students : please print and sign each digitally-signed DS-2019 that is issued to you. We recommend you keep copies of all DS-2019s issued to you either as paper documents or digitally-signed documents. Report Changes to Your Immigration Status Report any changes in your non-immigrant status from F-1/J-1 to any other status to OGS. You can report a change to becoming a permanent resident (green card holder) using this e-form . If your non-immigrant status changes to H-1B, you can submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form . Attend the School Listed on Page 1 of your Form I-20 (F-1 Students) or DS-2019 (J-1 Students) Submit the Mandatory Immigration Clearance Immediately Upon Arrival in the U.S. at the Start of your Program All international students with F-1 or J-1 status must complete the mandatory Immigration Clearance at the start of each new program of study. This is a U.S. government regulation for students to maintain their non-immigrant status. OGS facilitates this process, which is called “online immigration clearance.” Students who do not complete the mandatory immigration clearance within the deadline are not maintaining status and are at risk of SEVIS record termination. Students will receive emails regarding Immigration Clearance before the start of their academic program and can find more information regarding this process on the OGS website . Keep Your Immigration Documents Accurate and Up to Date Keep your passport valid at all times. The passport must be valid for at least 6 months into the future on the day you return to the U.S. from a trip abroad. Your F-1/J-1 visa may expire while you are inside the U.S. You only need to renew your F-1/J-1 visa if you are going to travel outside of the U.S. and need to return. Keep your I-20 or DS-2019 valid and accurate at all times and understand your end date. Remember that your I-20/DS-2019 is essentially a printout of your SEVIS record, and if things change, you must notify OGS so that the document can be updated . Extend your I-20 prior to its expiration date if you are unable to complete your academic program by the original end date. In the event of change of academic program or level, update your I-20 in a timely fashion in accordance with immigration regulations (see the “Change of Degree Level” section below) Notify OGS if you decide to finish your degree online from overseas, stop your program earlier than anticipated , or end an authorized period of CPT/OPT/STEM OPT earlier than anticipated and depart the U.S. Understand Your “Grace Period” After Program Completion F-1 and J-1 students enter what is called a “grace period” after they have completed their degree programs. This usually aligns with your I-20/DS-2019 program end date, or after you have completed all degree requirements, whichever is sooner. If you finish degree requirements before your I-20/DS-2019 end date, you must notify OGS so that your document can be updated, as your grace period and eligibility for certain benefits are based on your program completion. During the grace period, students can remain in the U.S. to travel or prepare to depart the U.S. Any on-campus employment must stop as of the I-20/DS-2019 program end date. F-1 Students : F-1 students who successfully complete their program are granted a 60-day grace period starting the day after their I-20 program end date. During the 60-day grace period, F-1 students are eligible for the following: To remain in the U.S. for traveling and preparing to depart the U.S. To request a change of degree level. To apply for post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT). To request a transfer if admitted to another SEVP-certified institution. During the 60-day grace period, F-1 students are NOT eligible for the following: Program extension: if you have remaining degree requirements after your I-20 program end date, you must request extension before the end date. J-1 Students : J-1 students who successfully complete their program are granted a 30-day grace period starting the day after their DS-2019 program end date. During the 30-day grace period, J-1 students are only eligible for the following: To remain in the U.S. for traveling and preparing to depart the U.S. During the 30-day grace period, J-1 students are NOT eligible for the following: To request to transfer to another U.S. institution. To apply for post-completion Academic Training (AT) – this must be requested prior to your DS-2019 end date. To request to begin a new degree program at Northeastern while remaining in the U.S. through “matriculation.” If you have not requested OPT/AT, a change of degree level, or received approval to transfer out, and you depart the U.S. during the grace period, your SEVIS record will be completed and you are no longer eligible to re-enter on your current I-20 or DS-2019."

                "section_content": "F-1 and J-1 Study Requirements (Click each topic below for more information) Make Normal Academic Progress and Stay in Good Academic Standing Review the academic requirements, academic policies, and minimum GPA requirements of your academic program and adhere to all requirements. Failure to maintain normal academic progress and academic standing may result in academic probation, dismissal, suspension or other negative consequences which may impact your ability to maintain full-time enrollment and your F-1/J-1 status. If you are academically dismissed, please review the OGS website and contact OGS as soon as possible to discuss your options. Please be sure to reach out for academic support early and often if you are experiencing challenges with coursework. Maintain Full-Time Enrollment You must maintain full-time enrollment each academic term (except during designated vacation periods) and make continuous academic progress towards the completion of your program of study. Full-time enrollment is as follows: Undergraduate: minimum of 12 credit hours per term Graduate: minimum of 8 credit hours per term (9 credit hours per term in a 3-credit enrollment system) Graduate students who hold an assistantship: minimum of 6 credit hours per term International students enrolled in NU Immerse/Global Pathways must follow the requirements of their programs Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS) The same rules regarding maintaining full-time enrollment, as explained above, apply to F-1 students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS), but there are important differences in program delivery. Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in two sessions (A and B) but still count as one full academic term. CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on-ground courses throughout the entire term. For instance, F-1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term. F-1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility! Maintain On-Ground Presence in Classes Students must maintain on-ground presence throughout the academic term. At Northeastern, there are four different defined instructional methods: Traditional, Hybrid, Live Cast, and Online. Traditional, Hybrid, and Live Cast courses meet the F-1 on-ground presence requirements. Online courses do not meet the F-1 on-ground presence requirements. You can learn more about the Defined Instructional Methods at Northeastern on the Registrar’s website. Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS) Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in one of two sessions (A and B) throughout the academic term. CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on-ground courses throughout the entire term. For instance, F-1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term. F-1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility! Maintain On-Ground Presence when Authorized for Curricular Practical Training (F-1 students) F-1 students must maintain on-ground presence while pursuing practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) Authorization. On-ground presence is a key component and requirement of F-1 nonimmigrant status and must be maintained during all required terms. Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during vacation periods. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In Person (Traditional) : All engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Hybrid : The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location Remote (Online) : The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer’s physical location To learn more about maintaining on-ground presence when authorized for CPT, please visit this webpage. Understand Limitations to Enrolling in Online Courses F-1 students have strict limitations to online course enrollment imposed by the U.S. federal government. In general, within minimum full-time credit requirements , F-1 students may be eligible to take a maximum of: one 3-credit online course, or one 4-credit online course in a 4-credit enrollment system or up to three credits total for 1-credit courses, for example, three 1-credit courses, or one 2-credit course and one 1-credit course Enrolling in two 2-credit online courses is not acceptable and considered a violation of F-1 status Students in NU Immerse/Global Pathways are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements Once F-1 students have met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements, they may enroll in additional online courses if needed/desired. J-1 students are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements. It is important that all F-1 and J-1 students contact their academic advisor before enrolling in online courses or withdrawing from any courses, so that they can make an informed decision about their enrollment. Understand Limitations on Reduced Course Loads With minor exceptions for non-required summer terms and your final term , you must maintain full-time enrollment and should not drop below a full-time course load unless you have received authorization from OGS in advance. You are not eligible for a reduced course load or a non-medical leave of absence without receiving prior authorization from OGS. Authorization must be obtained before the start of the term or before dropping any course(s) that would drop below full-time enrollment. Please see sections on reduced course load and leaves of absence for more information on these topics. Request a Leave of Absence in Advance If you need to take a Medical Leave of Absence or a Personal Leave of Absence , you must submit requests to both the University and OGS in advance . Do not drop or withdraw from your classes without final approval from OGS. There is no retroactive leave of absence authorization for students who drop classes without being approved for a leave. Follow Requirements for Study Abroad, Global Co-op, and Research Abroad Study Abroad and Global Co-op : If you are participating in a university-approved study abroad experience through the Global Experience Office or a university-approved Global Co-op, you must report your academic activities abroad to OGS. You are required to maintain full-time enrollment in order to maintain your F-1/J-1 student status while participating in approved academic activities abroad. Any changes in enrollment during your program could affect your ability to return to the U.S . Research Abroad : To be approved by OGS for research abroad, you must maintain your full-time registration status at Northeastern University. Additionally, your overseas research project must be required to complete your degree . Please refer to the Study Abroad, Research Abroad, and Global Co-op page of the OGS website for more information. Notify OGS of Any Change in Program or Degree Level in Advance If you are a current, continuing student at Northeastern and you will be starting a new program at Northeastern, you must submit a Change of Degree Level (CDL) e-form to OGS prior to starting the new program . This does not apply to undergraduate students who are changing majors. Please review OGS’ CDL webpage for more information and instructions: Change of Degree Level – officeofglobalservices (northeastern.edu) Notify OGS of Any Change of Major in Advance If you are a current, continuing undergraduate student at Northeastern and you will be 1) changing your major or 2) declaring your major, you must submit a I-20 of DS-2019 Request for Continuing Students e-form to OGS prior to starting the new program . This applies to students in the Explore Program and the General Studies Program. Once your request is reviewed and processed by OGS, you will receive a new I-20 with the same SEVIS ID number reflecting the new program information. You will not be required to submit an Immigration Clearance again for this new degree. If you are currently in a Master’s program and you are c hanging from one Master’s degree program to another Master’s degree program (either after completing the first, or without completing), please see Change of Degree Level information above. Transferring to Another U.S. School If you are an F-1 student who would like to transfer your SEVIS record from Northeastern University to another SEVP-certified institution, you should review the Transferring Out page of the OGS website and must submit a transfer out request to OGS so that we can release your SEVIS record. To have your SEVIS record transferred to your new institution, you must continue to maintain your F-1 student status until the transfer release date. You may request that our office transfer your SEVIS record prior to the end of your program at Northeastern, but the date that your new university receives your record should occur after you have completed your program or after your last date of attendance. If you have already completed your program, your transfer out date must occur within your 60-day grace period. Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree/Program Early F-1 students in their final term (even if it is earlier than their current I-20 end date) should review the Final Term page of the OGS website and submit the Intent to Complete e-form linked on that page. Your I-20/DS-2019 end date must correspond with your final term of enrollment. Therefore, if you will finish your program before your I-20/DS-2019 end date you must notify OGS so we can shorten your I-20/DS-2019 to reflect the term in which you completed all requirements for graduation. Remaining in the U.S. without full-time enrollment or taking other action to maintain/extend status even if your I-20/DS-2019 has an end date in the future is not considered maintaining status. If you are in your final term and are planning on applying for post-completion OPT or AT, your program end date will be adjusted accordingly if needed when OGS processes your request. Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree/Program Later Than Expected If you need additional time to complete your degree requirements, beyond your current I-20 or DS-2019 end date, you must apply for a Program Extension. To maintain your status, you must apply for this extension before your current I-20 or DS-2019 program end date . You can find more information about the Program Extension process on the OGS website. Intentionally failing classes to extend your I-20/DS-2019 is not a legitimate reason for a program extension and may be a violation of academic integrity policies which may impact your F-1/J-1 status."

Cultural and educational exchange are the primary purpose of this visa program. To learn more about the J Exchange Visitor Program, please read the U.S. Department of State’s Welcome Brochure or Bridge USA J-1 Student Page which summarizes many of your rights. You can find contact information for the U.S. Department of State below. Telephone: +1-(866)-283-9090 Email: [email protected] Maintain Full-Time Enrollment & On-Ground Presence If you are in the J-1 student degree category (bachelor’s, master’s, doctorate) and enrolled in a full-time degree program, the same requirements above in the “Study Requirements” section regarding full-time enrollment and maintaining on-ground presence apply to you. You may only count one online class towards your full-time enrollment requirement . Once you have met the full-time, on-ground enrollment requirement, you are eligible to take additional online classes that exceed your minimum credit requirements. Maintain Health Insurance Coverage U.S. government regulations [22 CFR § 62.14] require all J-1 students and J-2 dependents to obtain health insurance that meets the following requirements: Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness Payment for repatriation (preparation and transportation of remains to home country) in case of death in the amount of $25,000 Payment for medical evacuation (transportation to home country on advice of attending physician) in the amount of $50,000 A deductible amount not to exceed $500 per accident or illness Coverage of pre-existing conditions after a reasonable waiting period Payment by the insurance company of at least 75% of the costs of medical care (the patient must not be required to pay more than 25% of medical care costs) Continuous coverage for the duration of the program To comply with these regulations, health insurance policies must be underwritten by corporations having one of the following: A.M. Best rating of A- or above McGraw Hill Financial/Standard & Poor’s Claims- paying Ability rating of ‘A- or above Weiss Research, Inc. rating of ‘‘B+’’ or above Fitch Ratings, Inc. rating of ‘‘A-’’ or above Moody’s Investor Services rating of ‘‘A3’’ or above. Note: Insurance backed by the full faith and credit of the exchange visitor ‘s (J-1 scholar’s) government meets this requirement. If you purchased health insurance in your home country, please ensure that it covers all of the requirements listed above. OGS is not able to review individual plans to ensure they comply with these requirements. Please contact your health insurance provider to confirm your plan meets all requirements. The Northeastern Student Health Insurance Plan (NUSHP) meets the Department of State requirements. If your health insurance plan does not cover repatriation & medical evacuation, there are supplemental plans you can purchase to meet this requirement, including this plan offered by Gallagher Student Health & Special Risk. Willful non-compliance with this requirement would be a violation of your J-1 status and may result in termination of your SEVIS record. Matriculation & Changing Degree Level J- 1 degree -seeking students may be eligible to continue their program at a higher degree level through a process called “Matriculation.” This is only permissible to move t o ah higher degree level, for example – Bachelor ‘s to Master’s o r Master ’s to Doctorate/PhD. If you are in the J-1 n on-degree student category, you are not eligible for Matriculation as that would require a change of your J-1 category. Two-Year Home Residence Requirement (212e) Some J-1 are subject to the two-year home country physical presence requirement. It requires you to return home for at least two years after your exchange visitor program ends. You can check your visa stamp and consular-processed DS-2019 to see whether you are subject. Please read the OGS website for more information to understand this requirement and contact OGS if you have questions. 12- and 24-Month Bars The 12- and 24-month bars are different from the two-year home country residence requirement. The 12- and 24-month rule affects J-1 exchange visitors who have been in the U.S. inJ-1 status previously, and wish to return, using the J-1 Research Scholar. If you are in the J-1 degree student category and have a program length longer than 6 months, please note that you will automatically become subject to the 12-month bar. This will only impact your ability to return to the U.S. in the J-1 Research Scholar/Professor categories for 12 months (commonly used for Visiting Scholars/Researchers/Professors and Postdoctoral Fellows). Please review the OGS website for more information about the bars."

        "content": "Students Studying in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe United States Requesting Your I-20 (F-1) All admitted students who will be studying with an F-1 visa need an I-20 form in order to move forward with the visa process. What is an I-20? An I-20 is a U.S. immigration document issued by a university to certify that an F-1 student has met admission requirements and has proof of sufficient financial resources for his/her studies. An I-20 is required to apply for an F-1 student visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad. Newly admitted international students that have paid a deposit should request an I-20. The Office of Global Services (OGS) encourages you to submit your initial I-20 request as soon as possible because the visa process takes time. Who is an Initial student? New international students coming from outside the U.S. that are seeking F-1 visa status. Who is a Transfer Student? If a student currently has an Active Student and Exchange Visitor System (SEVIS) record with another SEVP-certified institution in the U.S., they may be eligible to transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University. T ransfer students must: Request to have their SEVIS record transferred out from their current institution to Northeastern University Apply for a Transfer I-20 from Northeastern University Please see the Requesting your Transfer-In I-20 page for more information. Who is a Change of Status student? If you are currently in the U.S. in a non-immigrant status (B-1/B-2, F-1, F-2, H-1b or H-4) and would like to change to a different non-immigrant status (F-1, F-2, J-1 or J-2), you must apply for a Change of Status I-20. Once you’ve received the Change of Status I-20 there are two options: Option 1: You may travel outside of the U.S., apply for a visa at a U.S. Embassy with all required materials, and re-enter the U.S. in the new status. This option is often referred to as Consular Processing. Option 2: You may apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to change your status without leaving the U.S. by completing Form I-539 Application to extend/change your non-immigrant status. This process can take between 6 and 9 months and it is recommended you do not travel while your application is in process. Please note: If your change of status application is approved by USCIS (option 2), your new F/J status will be active; however, you will not receive a corresponding visa in your passport that reflects the new status . As a result, you will need to apply for a new visa stamp at an embassy/consulate outside of the U.S. in order to re-enter the U.S. in F/J status. To learn more about change of status and see which option is best for you, please schedule an appointment with an advisor at the Office of Global Services (OGS) by calling +1-617-373-2310. Video: Change to F-1 Student Status Video: Change to F-1 Student Status within the U.S. TRAVELING WITH A PENDING CHANGE OF STATUS We don’t recommend traveling outside of the U.S. while your application with USCIS is still pending. If you can’t avoid traveling, please consult with OGS beforehand as you may need to reach out to USCIS to withdraw your application prior to traveling and submit a new I-20 request with OGS. CURRICULAR PRACTICAL TRAINING (CPT) AND OPTIONAL PRACTICAL TRAINING (OPT) In order to be eligible for both CPT and OPT, you must have maintained full time enrollment with appropriate on-ground presence for at least one academic year. One academic year is defined as two semesters or three quarters. It may be possible for you to use your time in another status towards meeting the one academic year. If you are a change of status student and have questions about CPT/OPT eligibility, please call OGS to schedule an appointment with an advisor by calling +1-617-373-2310. What is a Change of Degree Level? If you are a current, continuing student at Northeastern and you will be starting a new program at Northeastern, you must submit a Change of Degree Level e-form request to myOGS prior to starting the new program . Please see the Guidelines on Maintaining Status page for more information. Suggested Deadlines to Submit Your I-20 Request OGS recommends that you submit your completed I-20 request e-form by the following dates to allow time for visa processing. The suggested deadlines are a guide and do not guarantee you will receive the visa in time for your program. Spring CPS Quarter 2025 (April 7, 2025 start date) February 1 7 , 202 5 :  Initial I-20 request Graduate Certificate, M.S. and PhD. For students outside of the U.S. March 17 , 202 5 : Transfer I-20 request or international students already in the U.S. Campus Changes Prior to Arrival in the U.S. Please note that the I-20 you receive from OGS is created specifically for the campus that you indicated you will be studying. To avoid any issues or delays with your F-1 visa application, OGS encourages students to commit to their campus before requesting their I-20. All campus changes must be approved by the admissions department prior to requesting an I-20. If you have already been issued an I-20 and have been approved to change campuses, your I-20 will be cancelled, and you will be issued a new I-20 with a different SEVIS ID. If you have already paid the I-901 fee with your previous SEVIS record, you may request to transfer the payment to the new SEVIS record. If your visa application has already been approved and you wish to transfer to another Northeastern campus, your previous I-20 will be cancelled and we advise you to re-apply for the F-1 visa. It may be possible to request a change of campus when you are a current student. Please speak to your Academic Advisor if you wish to pursue this option. How to prepare and submit an online request: After confirming your enrollment, you will be able to submit an electronic I-20 request through myOGS. 1 Confirm your Enrollment You are required to confirm your enrollment by following the instructions on your official decision letter, which may include arranging to pay (e.g. by credit card) an enrollment deposit.

Once you claim your Student Hub account, your myOGS account will be created within 24-48 hours and you will be able to access the links to make a request within the portal.

If you are currently in the U.S. in a non-immigrant status (B-1/B-2, F-1, F-2, H-1b or H-4) and would like to change to a different non-immigrant status (F-1, F-2, J-1 or J-2), you must apply for a Change of Status I-20. Once you’ve received the Change of Status I-20 there are two options: Option 1: You may travel outside of the U.S., apply for a visa at a U.S. Embassy with all required materials, and re-enter the U.S. in the new status. This option is often referred to as Consular Processing. Option 2: You may apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to change your status without leaving the U.S. by completing Form I-539 Application to extend/change your non-immigrant status. This process can take between 6 and 9 months and it is recommended you do not travel while your application is in process. Please note: If your change of status application is approved by USCIS (option 2), your new F/J status will be active; however, you will not receive a corresponding visa in your passport that reflects the new status . As a result, you will need to apply for a new visa stamp at an embassy/consulate outside of the U.S. in order to re-enter the U.S. in F/J status. To learn more about change of status and see which option is best for you, please schedule an appointment with an advisor at the Office of Global Services (OGS) by calling +1-617-373-2310. Video: Change to F-1 Student Status Video: Change to F-1 Student Status within the U.S. TRAVELING WITH A PENDING CHANGE OF STATUS We don’t recommend traveling outside of the U.S. while your application with USCIS is still pending. If you can’t avoid traveling, please consult with OGS beforehand as you may need to reach out to USCIS to withdraw your application prior to traveling and submit a new I-20 request with OGS. CURRICULAR PRACTICAL TRAINING (CPT) AND OPTIONAL PRACTICAL TRAINING (OPT) In order to be eligible for both CPT and OPT, you must have maintained full time enrollment with appropriate on-ground presence for at least one academic year. One academic year is defined as two semesters or three quarters. It may be possible for you to use your time in another status towards meeting the one academic year. If you are a change of status student and have questions about CPT/OPT eligibility, please call OGS to schedule an appointment with an advisor by calling +1-617-373-2310."

Learn what you need to know. Electronic Arrival Record/Form I-94 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspects all foreign national students, scholars, dependents, and visitors to the U.S. arriving at an air, land, or sea border and grants admission to the U.S. in an appropriate immigration classification status (including F-1, J-1, etc). Admission to the U.S. in a specific immigration status is documented via an entry stamp in the passport as well as an electronic or paper Form I-94 arrival record. Electronic Form I-94 records can be downloaded and printed here. Occasionally when entering the U.S., errors may occur on the passport stamp notation, electronic Form I-94 record, or paper Form I-94 card. These errors must be corrected to ensure that the status of the student, scholar, dependent, or visitor is documented properly and that immigration benefits (such as permission to study or work) are correctly applied. What Should the Form I-94 Say? How Can I Correct My Form I-94 Record? There are two ways to correct an I-94 card/record or a passport stamp notation. If you need immediate assistance or if the error was made on your paper Form I-94 card or passport stamp, then you must go in person to the CBP Deferred Inspection Office. However, if your passport notation is correct and the error was made to your electronic Form I-94 record, then you may be able to resolve this matter by e-mail. Option #1: Going in Person to the CBP Deferred Inspection Office Deferred Inspection is part of Customs and Border Protection. Deferred Inspection sites provide assistance to individuals at the time of entry or after their entry if an immediate decision was not determined.

Option #2: Requesting an I-94 Correction by E-Mail NOTE : Corrections to a paper Form I-94 card or passport stamp can only be done in person.

This page contains information related to travel dates, recommended steps for successful travel to the U.S. and Northeastern campuses, and other helpful tips upon arrival. Planning Your Travel last updated 2/5/2025 All F-1 and J-1 students are expected to arrive at Northeastern University by the program start date that is listed on their Form I-20/DS-2019 in order to appropriately abide by federal regulations. The program start dates on the Form I-20/DS-2019 are aligned with the Academic Calendar of the University. Plan on arriving by the first day of the program start date listed on your Form I-20/DS-2019. Remember: Students can only enter the United States 30 days before the program start date listed on their Form I-20/DS-2019. Students who attempt to enter the U.S more than 30 days before their program start date may be found inadmissible by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Upon entry to the U.S., you must complete the Online Immigration Clearance check-in so OGS can activate your SEVIS record in a timely manner. Late Arrivals We recognize that some students may experience extenuating circumstances outside of their control, and that may delay their arrival by a few days. If you find out that you are unable to arrive for the first day of classes, you must submit a request through the Slate portal, and notify your College contact. Graduate Students : Please submit a request for late arrival: Log into your Slate student portal. At the top of the page, you will see a tab “Manage Your Application” Click on “Submit a Request” and select “I have a late arrival request” Undergraduate Students : Please submit a request for late arrival: Log into your Slate student portal . At the top of the page, you will see a tab “Manage Your Application” Click on “Submit a Request” and select “I have a late arrival request” All Students: Please also email your college contact . You may click here for a list of each College’s contacts. If your late arrival request is approved, you will be able to review and download your letter in the Slate portal. A late arrival support letter does not guarantee entry to the U.S. as all students should be entering the U.S. by the program start date listed on their I-20/DS-2019. Term I-20 Program Start Date Last Day of University Add Date CPS Graduate Spring 2025 Quarter April 7, 2025 April 20, 2025 No late arrivals may be approved by your College beyond the University Add/Drop deadline. If your Form I-20/DS-2019 has not yet been issued by your program’s start date, or you are not able to arrive before the Add/Drop deadline, you are not eligible for late arrival and you will be required to defer your program. Please find more information here. Traveling to the U.S. Please be sure to click each section and item below and carefully read the information. Contact OGS if you have questions about these requirements. Apply for a Visa Learn more about the Visa application process here If you have recently applied for a F-1 or J-1 visa, submit the Visa Application Status form via myOGS . We do not recommend making travel plans until you have valid documents for travel. Arrange your travel We recommend that you make travel plans after you’ve received confirmation that your F-1 or J-1 visa has been issued! Register your travel Register your travel with the University’s Travel Registry. This is available via “MyTravelPlans” in the Student Hub or directly through the GardaWorld Travel Security Portal (sign in with your Northeastern email address). More information on the Travel Registry can be found here and here . Contact [email protected] for travel registry assistance. Gather Required Documents Ensure that you have gathered and printed the following important paperwork and pack it in your carry-on luggage for easy access: Entry/visa supporting documents: Original Form I-20 or DS-2019 (make sure you have signed it in the appropriate spot) A valid F-1/J-1 visa stamp (in your passport) Passport, valid for at least six months into the future from the date of your arrival You must also travel with: Any previously issued I-20s/DS-2019s Acceptance Letter from Northeastern University Proof of SEVIS Fee Payment (I-901 Fee Receipt) Proof of enrollment: F-1/J-1 students are required to be signed up for a full-time course-load every required academic term: Print-out of your registered full time on-ground course-load for the upcoming academic term or ensure your ability to log into your student hub to show your full-time enrollment status Proof of Funding. F-1/J-1 students are required to show proof of funds to study in the States . It is recommended that this is the same proof of funding presented at your F-1/J-1 visa interview, which includes, but is not limited to: Documentation that shows you currently have the liquid funds to pay tuition, e.g. bank account records. Documentation that you have paid tuition or are engaged in a payment plan. You can find out information about paying your tuition and billing information at the Student Financial Services Website . Other financial documentation that shows that you can support your living expenses as a full-time student. Research possible restrictions for the duration of your travel Determine what is needed for you to comply with the relevant regulations for your travel (e.g. departure, connections, customs) according to your citizenship(s) and immigration documentation at each checkpoint. Be aware of the specific exit requirements from your point of origin and the entry requirements at any transit points, as well as the point of entry in the U.S. Adhere to airlines’ COVID-19 safety requirements (if there are any). If in doubt about any information, contact the relevant immigration or government authority of the countries of the travel. Arriving at a U.S. Port of Entry Primary Inspection When you arrive at the U.S. Port of Entry, you will first go through Primary Inspection. Make sure to notify someone that you have arrived at the airport before you go through immigration control. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) will conduct an inspection to determine if you are eligible to enter the U.S. As such, be prepared to present the documentation that you provided at the visa interview. They may also ask you some basic questions. Provide truthful answers and ask for clarification if needed. Be sure to tell the CBP officer that you will be studying at Northeastern University as an F-1 student, or a J-1 exchange visitor when you present your I-20 and F-1 visa or DS-2019 and J-1 visa. Remember that an F-1/J-1 visa is a travel document that allows you to request entry/admission into the U.S. as an international student. CBP ha s final authority to grant or deny entry and may conduct a full review of your documentation showing full-time enrollment and financial ability to study in the U.S. For more information about CBP Immigration Inspection, visit their website about clearing customs . There are many items that cannot be brought into the U.S. or that need to be declared upon entry. Please check out the Customs and Border Protection Website for more information. You will be issued an electronic I-94, which indicates your nonimmigrant status in the U.S, which should be F-1 student status or J-1 exchange visitor status. Generally, this step should not last more than a few minutes. Until recently, visa holders received an entry stamp in their passports, and the CBP officers noted D/S (Duration of Status) on F-1 and J-1 visa passport pages; this meant you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the length of time indicated on your I-20 or DS-2019, provided that you maintain full-time enrollment and a valid F-1/J-1 visa status. Many U.S. airports have discontinued stamping passports with an entry stamp when entering the U.S. Instead, each time you enter the U.S., the CBP creates an online, electronic entry record to record your entry into the U.S. This is called your I-94 record (Scroll down to read Check Your I-94 Record for more information). If everything is in order, the CBP officer will return all of your documentation they inspected, and you can proceed to collect any checked luggage and/or transfer. Ensure that you have collected all of your belongings before exiting the immigration inspection area. If the officer has additional questions, you may be directed to Secondary Inspection. Secondary Inspection Secondary Inspection (also called Deferred Inspection) allows a CBP officer more time to ask you additional questions and gather information to determine if you may be allowed entry. Should you need further assistance at the Port of Entry, please remember that Northeastern University can be your main point of contact . The officer may ask you additional questions or try to reach out to Northeastern to confirm your status. If additional information regarding your F-1 or J-1 status is needed, please request that the CBP officer calls the university to speak to a Designated School Official (DSO) for F-1 visa holders or Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) for J-1 visa holders, using the following contact information (The operations center is staffed 24/7 for this purpose): International Safety Office: +1.617.373.2121 (NUPD) [email protected] This office is open even outside of normal business hours. This office can best support you when you have registered your travel in advance so that they can easily access your travel details. Office of Global Services: +1.617.373.2310 Please see our Contact page for operations hours. Most importantly, ensure that you cooperate with the officer as much as possible so as not to create further difficulties. More information on Secondary Inspection can be found here . Check your I-94 Record The I-94 is an admission record that contains information about your most recent entry to the U.S. It is issued to all international travelers who enters the U.S. (with the exceptions of those who are part of a visa waiver program), and is updated with each entry you make . It contains your basic biographical information, as well as information about your visa status and how long you are allowed to remain in the U.S. Once you have successfully cleared inspection and entered the US, you should retrieve your electronic I-94 record here . Note that it may take a few days after your entry for the record to populate. You should check and save a screenshot of your I-94 record each time you enter the U.S. as the I-94 is the only official evidence of your entry into the U.S. Please review your I-94 record for accuracy. Two fields you may be unfamiliar with are “Class of Admission” and “Admit Until Date.” These fields should be filled out as follows: Class of Admission: matches what is listed on your visa stamp Admit Until Date: D/S (This stands for “Duration of Status”) Visa status other than F-1/J-1 must be corrected immediately (B-1/B-2, WT, or WB status does not permit full-time study in the U.S.) If anything looks incorrect on your I-94 record, please visit this page for more information on how to request a correction. Form I-515 or I-515A The CBP officer may issue you a Form I-515A if you are missing paperwork, or if they are not able to verify your status. This form allows you temporary entrance into the US for up to 30 days, during which time you must collect and submit the necessary evidence to the government to be able to remain in the US for the duration of your F-1 or J-1 status. If you receive a Form I-515A, the Office of Global Services (OGS) is happy to provide guidance with your response to the government. Please complete the Request to Comply with I-515A e-form to notify us so that we may best assist. Note that an I-515A should not have any negative impact on your status as long as you respond in a timely manner. More information on the form I-515A can be found here . Traveling to Boston from the Airport Car Service A car service is great way to pre-arrange a convenient and safe ride from the airport to your final destination. OGS recommends Boston Carriage. Click here to visit their website and enter your reservation details. Use promo code HUSKY2020 for a 5% discount! Tips for using Boston Carriage : Book your ride in advance as soon as possible to guarantee that there is availability on your date of travel. You will receive detailed instructions about where to meet your driver upon your arrival. Make sure to build in a 60-minute delay for clearing Customs & Border Protection and baggage claim after your flight arrival time. Traveling with friends or family? Consider booking a van instead of a car so there is enough room for your luggage. Expect “no-contact service” to decrease risk of COVID-19 transmission; this means all cars are outfitted with a partition between the driver and passenger area, the driver will be wearing a face mask, and vehicles will be sanitized before/after pick-up. Ride-Share Apps (such as Uber or Lyft) Download the app before you travel. You can log onto wifi at the airport to use the app and communicate with your driver. Some airports, such as Boston-Logan, have a designated Ride App pick-up area. After collecting your luggage from baggage claim, follow signs and head to the appropriate spot before ordered the ride. Always check that the license plate of the car matches the information in the app to make sure you are getting into the correct car. Ask your driver to wear a mask and put down the windows for airflow to decrease risk of transmission of COVID-19. Public Transportation Depending on your final destination, public transportation can be a great way to get around your new city! Make sure to look up in advance directions to get from the airport to your destination. Many areas have a transportation app you can download before you arrive. Traveling to Northeastern for Commencement International students, who graduated in a previous academic term, but who want to participate in graduate ceremonies at a later date (for example, a student who graduates at the end of the fall academic term wants to participate in graduation ceremonies at the end of the spring academic term), will have a Completed SEVIS record if they did not apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) or continue in a new academic program. This means that your F-1/J-1 visa and I-20/DS-2019 are no longer valid for entry to the U.S. (even if they have a future end date) as you are no longer enrolled in a program of study. Do not request a travel signature since you are no longer eligible for this benefit. Utilize alternate visas for travel to the U.S. such as a Visitor Visa or the Visa Waiver Program if you are a citizen of a participating country.

It contains your basic biographical information, as well as information about your visa status and how long you are allowed to remain in the U.S. Once you have successfully cleared inspection and entered the US, you should retrieve your electronic I-94 record here . Note that it may take a few days after your entry for the record to populate. You should check and save a screenshot of your I-94 record each time you enter the U.S. as the I-94 is the only official evidence of your entry into the U.S. Please review your I-94 record for accuracy. Two fields you may be unfamiliar with are “Class of Admission” and “Admit Until Date.” These fields should be filled out as follows: Class of Admission: matches what is listed on your visa stamp Admit Until Date: D/S (This stands for “Duration of Status”) Visa status other than F-1/J-1 must be corrected immediately (B-1/B-2, WT, or WB status does not permit full-time study in the U.S.) If anything looks incorrect on your I-94 record, please visit this page for more information on how to request a correction."

Click here to visit their website and enter your reservation details. Use promo code HUSKY2020 for a 5% discount! Tips for using Boston Carriage : Book your ride in advance as soon as possible to guarantee that there is availability on your date of travel. You will receive detailed instructions about where to meet your driver upon your arrival. Make sure to build in a 60-minute delay for clearing Customs & Border Protection and baggage claim after your flight arrival time. Traveling with friends or family? Consider booking a van instead of a car so there is enough room for your luggage. Expect “no-contact service” to decrease risk of COVID-19 transmission; this means all cars are outfitted with a partition between the driver and passenger area, the driver will be wearing a face mask, and vehicles will be sanitized before/after pick-up. Ride-Share Apps (such as Uber or Lyft) Download the app before you travel. You can log onto wifi at the airport to use the app and communicate with your driver. Some airports, such as Boston-Logan, have a designated Ride App pick-up area. After collecting your luggage from baggage claim, follow signs and head to the appropriate spot before ordered the ride. Always check that the license plate of the car matches the information in the app to make sure you are getting into the correct car. Ask your driver to wear a mask and put down the windows for airflow to decrease risk of transmission of COVID-19. Public Transportation Depending on your final destination, public transportation can be a great way to get around your new city! Make sure to look up in advance directions to get from the airport to your destination. Many areas have a transportation app you can download before you arrive."

J-1 Visiting Students subject to the 212(e) are also not eligible to request a change of status to another nonimmigrant status while inside the United States, with the exception of A and G classifications. The 212(e) applies to J-1 Visiting Students in one of the following situations: They received direct government funding, either from their home country or the U.S., for the purpose of international exchange. Their country has an Exchange Visitor Skills List and their field of research is on this list. They came to the U.S. in the J-1 Alien Physician category to participate in medical residency .

Applies to both J-1 Visiting Students and J-2 dependents. Does not prevent individuals from returning to the U.S. in any visa status other than H, L, K, or greencard. IMPORTANT - 2024 Skills List Update The Department of State (DOS) has released an update of the J-1 Exchange Visitor Skills List (“Skills List”) effective December 9, 2024 . The revised list removes a large number of countries and broadens opportunities for current or former J-1 nonimmigrants to remain in or return to the United States. The Federal Register Notice states that the 2024 Skills List will apply retroactively. As such, J nonimmigrant exchange visitors who were subject to the two-year home residence requirement at the time of their admission or acquisition of J status based on designations in a previously published Skills List will no longer be subject to that requirement if their country is not designated in this revised list . This change does not affect foreign nationals who may be subject to the J-1 home residency requirement on bases other than the Skills List, such as receipt of government funding for their J-1 program or entry as a foreign medical graduate. These foreign nationals will still be required to either fulfill the two-year requirement or seek a waiver. Please email [email protected] if you have any questions about the 2024 Skills List update. Advisory Opinion If the J-1 Visiting Student believes they have been incorrectly subjected to the 212(e) per the reasons above, or the 212(e) information on the J-1 visa does not match the DS-2019, they should request an advisory opinion from the Department of State. The Office of Global Services (OGS) is not able to directly assist or prepare documentation for this process. 212(e) Waiver In some cases, J-1 Visiting Students subject to the 212(e) may apply for a waiver from the Department of State. J-1 Visiting Students considering applying for a waiver should notify OGS. If the waiver is pending with USCIS or approved, the J-1 Visiting Student will not be eligible for a program extension even if they have not yet reached the five-year program duration maximum.
